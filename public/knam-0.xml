Historically the estate belonged to a number of aristocratic families.[3] When these neighbouring families intermarried, their combined estates in Abbotstown and the townland of Sheephill[4] were usually, though informally, called "Abbotstown". Despite a significant level of suburban development in the wider Dublin 15 area from the 1980s onwards, Abbotstown and Sheephill remained largely undeveloped, as the demesne was held by several state bodies. Today, the majority of the combined demesne remains unspoilt and now accommodates the administration offices and sporting grounds of the various bodies associated with Ireland`s National Sports Campus. Abbotstown proper, however, does not contain any part of the campus nor the eponymous Abbotstown House itself. Instead, almost the whole of the land is given over to Connolly Hospital and the "St Francis Hospice".</descriptionfull><propertyareaid>1012</propertyareaid></propertyarea><propertyarea><id>1127</id><descriptionbrief>Ashtown</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Ashtown (Irish: Baile an Ásaigh) is a small suburb of Dublin, Ireland.

18</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>Beachcomber is a rare find ideally located in South County Dublin between the DART line and the sea.</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Beachcomber is a rare find ideally located in South County Dublin between the DART line and the sea. The historic cul-de-sac, Corbawn Lane, ends less than 200m from the property in a walkway to Shankill Beach. This is ideal for an invigorating swim, walking the dog, or just relaxing and enjoying the panoramic vista stretching from Dalkey Island to Bray Head.&lt;br /&gt;The house itself is well-set back from the road with a spacious front garden planted with palms and eucalyptus, hidden behind a mature hedge. &lt;br /&gt;Beachcomber is well distanced from nearby dwellings with gardens on both sides and to the rear giving plenty of play space and room to extend if so desired (S.P.P.). Part of the side garden was recently hived off for another dwelling which is now substantially completed. Even so, the remaining site area extends to a generous 0.16acre/0.065ha. The plot has been legally sub-divided, a new fence erected between the two properties, and planning permission has been obtained for separate driveways. There is off-street parking which will comfortably fit at least four cars. &lt;br /&gt;Shankill is a well established community with respected schools and a wide range of sports and leisure options such a Shankill Tennis Club, Shankill GAA Club, Shankill FC, Shanganagh Park, Woodbrook Golf Club, and the pretty gardens at Corke Lodge.&lt;br /&gt;At the top of Corbawn Lane there is a new Lidl Shopping Centre and medical centre. Past this is Shankill Village with a lovely range of shops and restaurants including the popular Brady`s Pub with sport screens and food options. This marks the start of The Dublin Mountains Way leading via a lovely peaceful forest walk through Rathmichael Woods to The Leadmines and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commuters will appreciate the convenience of this location just four minutes walk from Shankill DART Station, with easy access to the M50, N11, and the park and ride at the Cherrywood. Beside the Cherrywood LUAS stop there is a brand new shopping centre, to rival Dundrum, currently under construction. Dunnes Stores in Cornelscourt is just 10 minutes drive away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation extending to approx. 132 Sq. meters comprises of an entrance porch, hall, living room, family room, kitchen/dining room, and downstairs guest WC.  Upstairs the landing leads to four bedrooms with master en-suite, and a large family bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Beachcomber is a rare find ideally located in South County Dublin between the DART line and the sea.

Vacant, awaiting a new owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewings available by appointment from 10th May. Email now to schedule viewing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Churchview is situated just where Glenalbyn Road turns into St. Brigid`s Church Road, five minutes walk from Stillorgan Shopping Centre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main living area in this gorgeous top floor apartment is flooded with light from a large westerly facing, floor-to-ceiling bay window and adjacent balcony looking out towards St. Brigid`s Church tower. It is the premium location within the Churchview development on the end of the block closest to Stillorgan Village, giving it additional floor area and a quieter aspect.  The floor area measures 67.7 sq.m plus balcony of 8.7 sq.m giving a total area of 76.4 sq.m.(822 sq.ft.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been very nicely modernized and upgraded by the current owner-occupiers, with high quality fixtures and fittings. It boasts nice touches like chrome electrical fittings and door handles, dimmer switches, brand new carpets and good quality kitchen appliances. To supplement the large hot press there are extensive fitted storage units in the hallway (with an integrated space for an additional appliance), and fitted wardrobes in both bedrooms. It has been impeccably maintained. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This apartment boasts high efficiency gas fired central heating with dual controls for hot water and radiators. The radiators are also fitted with TRV valves giving additional savings. It has high quality double-glazed windows throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Churchview is a small development of just 12 apartments, with plenty of parking and bike storage securely situated behind automatic gates. The lift and spacious glazed stairwell lead directly from the parking spaces to the landing outside #9. To the rear is a small communal garden with a manicured lawn surrounded by trees and hedging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This location is served by an abundance of bus routes travelling every couple of minutes along the QBC. A 20 minute walk up Merville Road and through Clonmore Park brings you to the Stillorgan LUAS stop. Clonmore Park boasts a superb children`s playground. Churchview is close to a wide range of primary and secondary schools. It is just 2 minutes walk from the Kilmacud Crokes GAA grounds in Glenalbyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Service Charge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;€2,413.00 Yearly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Modern, beautifully presented top floor apartment with westerly facing balcony, in walk-in condition.

To comply with COVID guidelines, we will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#169 is a well-presented first floor apartment attractively laid out with a nice open-plan kitchen/living/dining space filled with natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and a glazed door to the large balcony looking out over the water feature in the courtyard below. This is one of the few apartments to benefit from both a balcony and a dining space in the bay window area. There is a separate laundry room off the hall freeing up space in the shaker style kitchen for cooking and storage. The double bedroom is quite spacious with plenty of room for a large double bed as well as the fitted wardrobe, a desk and a dressing table if required. When the windows are open, the peaceful sound of flowing water invites you to relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gardens in The Island are beautifully laid out with riverside walks, entertainment platforms, and a lawn area with pretty views of the river serenely reflecting a weeping willow in the still waters above the weir. The old mill stream flows through a lock gate creating a peaceful channel for the ducks and nesting swans. The water flow in the River Liffey at this point is very well controlled by four upstream dams, ensuring that there are no watery surprises in the underground parking, even in the wettest of weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the main gate there is pedestrian access across a footbridge from the centre of Chapelizod Village which boasts a long and varied history combined with a vibrant day and night life. This pedestrian route continues across the village square and up Park Lane to the wide open spaces of The Phoenix Park. If you dream of owning a dog and having plenty of space for walkies, pets are permitted in this development (provided they do not cause a nuisance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here there is an excellent bus service to Dublin city centre and cycle/walking paths along the river bank. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This development benefits from an on-site conceirge service helping to ensure it is always well-maintained and kept under a watchful eye. There is an on-site security guard in the evenings till midnight or 2am on weekends. Being on an island it can only be accessed via a bridge, ensuring nobody can sneak in unseen (unless they get very wet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is extensive and securely gated underground space under the whole development. This gives room for bin storage, parking and lots of bike storage in two securely locked bike store rooms or one of the many additional bike racks.This apartment comes with one designated underground parking space with secure gated access. The assigned space is on the end of a row, giving extra width for ease of access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with all this the service charge is only €1500 per annum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Island and the sister complex in The Weir were well built 2003-2005 by the highly respected development company Danniger.  In total there are 250 apartments in the development. It replaced an old industrial complex on an island in the river formed by a mill stream starting at the weir. This stream was dug to power an 18th century mill. The footbridge dates from around this time. Archaelogical excavations on the site uncovered a much earlier mill and Hiberno-Norse artifacts which could date back to the 8th or 9th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email.

viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact time for a viewing appointment within the advertised time range. Alternatively we are happy to do private viewings by appointment at this property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cielito (D18 P2X2) is a generous bungalow in an elevated setting nestled into the hillside, with views across the Southside of Dublin and Dublin Bay to Howth Head.  It is securely situated behind new granite walls and 4m wide electric gates. This is an ideal property for entertaining with its interconnecting reception rooms opening to a large terrace. To the rear the spacious kitchen/breakfast room has a window and patio doors opening to a bright and  beautiful SW facing sun patio. A second set of patio doors opens to a wonderfully bright conservatory getting all day sunshine. There is a quiet and cosy back lounge with a corner fireplace also opening to the conservatory. Off the hallway are four bedrooms with master ensuite and a family bathroom. A spiral staircase leads to a mezzanine over the entrance hall, off which are two attic spaces. One is a large attic room with two skylights. With an apex height of 2.55m this could easily be converted to a habitable room with outstanding views. On the other side of the mezzanine is an unfinished attic space with limited ceiling height. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large triple garage, 10m deep, extends under the terrace and front room. In front of this is a front lawn 8m x 10m which will be finished and set in grass. There is a 4.5m wide driveway running along the side of the property, with vehicular doors leading to the back sun patio. At the back of the patio is a garden pond set into the sloped back garden. From the top of the garden there is a fabulous view, which could be a great backdrop for a garden studio. Behind this, to the rear of this property, is agricultural land on the lower slopes of Three Rock Mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cielito is conveniently located less than 20 minutes walk from Marlay Park, Wesley College and the 14, 16 and 75 bus routes in Ballinteer. There is a convenience store, pharmacy, medical centre and creche nearby in Ticknock Hill. Recreational facilities in the area include hill walking and mountain biking in The Dublin Mountains, riding stables at The Paddocks and Kellystown, golf at Stackstown and The Grange, Lamb Doyle`s, The Blue Light and Taylor`s Three Rock are close by. Employment hubs in Sandyford Business Park, Central Park and South County Business Park are easily accessible, as is shopping in Dundrum Town Centre and Beacon South Quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Balackglen Road is currently undergoing substantial improvements. A sign at the roadworks states that they are due for completion in February 2023. Once these are done it will have cycle lanes and footpaths stretching from Marlay Park to Lamb Doyle`s and Lamb`s Cross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new granite wall has been constructed in front of the property with a recessed entrance giving plenty of space to stop off the roadway while the new electric gates are opening. As part of these work a new sewer is being installed to which Cielito will be connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cielito is on the Blackglen Road. It is the second house on the south side of the road to the East of the M50 bridge.  NB: There is no road noise from the M50 as it goes through a deep cut here.  When viewing you may park in the gateway or inside the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: Yes&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email.

It sits on it`s own grounds with abundant parking, tennis courts and garden seating. There is a laundry room for resident use, on the ground floor. Nearby shops include a Pharmacy, Dry Cleaners, Hardware Store, Bike shop, Woodbine Post Office, Spar, Insomnia, Pizza Hut, Domino`s, and Winnie`s Craft Cafe and Ice Cream Parlour.

Large SW facing back garden. Less than 10 minutes walk from LUAS or QBC.</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Viewers should register in advance to ensure they can be facilitated within COVID guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built circa 1959 this family home currently extends to 102.6 sq.m. with further potential to incorporate the rest of the garage and the side passage. Additionally it gives options to to extend over the garage (S.P.P.) and/or into the large back garden. The attic space may be suitable for conversion to living space from where dormer windows to the front would have panoramic views across Dublin Bay (S.P.P.). Works like these have already been done by a number of the neighbouring properties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is situated in a highly desirable location on a quiet loop at the top end of Merville Road. There is no through traffic. At this point Weirview Drive is a wide road from which the homes are well set back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internally, while requiring modernization, this property has been well maintained over the years. The external walls appear to be cavity walls which are less susceptible to damp and are suitable for injection foam insulation. This property has never been fitted with central heating. We understand that the original pine floorboards are still intact under the carpets. It still has the two original fireplaces. The only significant modification from the original layout is the construction of a new downstairs bathroom off the entrance hall, extending into the garage space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the front and back gardens here are bright and spacious. The back garden is the perfect southwest facing orientation to make the most of the natural sunshine. It is very private and not overlooked. There is a nice bonus at the bottom of the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property backs onto Clonmore Park which is easily accessed via a pedestrian way from the top of Merville Road. It has a lovely playground and plenty of space to walk a dog or kick a ball. The wooded area at the rear of the property is securely separated from the park by a high palisade fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are superb transport options with the LUAS and the QBC both within 10 minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From St. Brigid`s Church Road, running parallel to the N11 in Stillorgan, turn onto Merville Road.

Potential to extend further if required (s.p.p).</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>All viewers should register in advance by email, so that we can arrange an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your are invited to put your own stamp on this bright and spacious home with a side gate to a delightful 53ft long / 33ft wide private back garden, with greenhouse. 14 Dale Road is a solid built 1950s family home in a highly desirable and well-settled community close to Stillorgan Shopping Centre, This property has been extended to the side and rear to give 173.6 sq.m. of accommodation (including attic). The side extension has two rooms and it`s own planning-approved separate front door making it ideal as a home work-space, a semi-independent 4th bedroom/living area, or playroom and au-pair bedroom. This property is exceptionally bright, through the use of skylights and French doors connecting the living space to the back garden. The main rooms are well proportioned with large windows and higher ceilings. To the front is a large living room with a natural wood fireplace flanked by recessed shelving. To the rear is a large open-plan kitchen/dining room flooded with natural light. This boasts a second matching fireplace. Off the kitchen is a handy utility room and a lobby leading to a downstairs shower room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are three bedrooms and a family bathroom. The two larger bedrooms would both easily fit twin beds or a full-size queen bed with lots of extra space. From the landing a further flight of stairs leads up to the attic which has been converted to useful extra space with three Velux skylights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Property appears to have been rewired and is heated by gas fired central heating. The water tank has recently been replaced. It is in need of new decor. Once that is done it will make a truly delightful family home.

18</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>Detached house facing a large green.</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Viewings start on 16th &amp; 17th July. All viewers should register in advance by email, so that we can arrange an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1a Vale View Avenue is a fine detached house on a corner site facing a large green. It is newer than most of the other houses in The Park and built to higher specifications. It has four large double bedrooms on the first floor and a 5th bedroom with ensuite on the ground floor, in a small self-contained unit. In addition there are three reception rooms (including a partitioned sunroom) and two handy attic storage rooms. There are bathrooms on all levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid oak flooring in the hall, sitting room and dining area creates a natural flow through the house. The spacious sitting room has a large bay-effect window looking out on the green in front of the house. It boasts an attractive white marble fireplace with contrasting black granite hearth. Glazed double doors lead from here to the open-plan kitchen/dining room which is at the heart of this home. The Rangemaster cooking range and the central black granite-topped work space with breakfast bar provide the focal points. To the rear is a spacious sunroom with pine flooring which has been partitioned into two to create an artists studio and a back lounge. This space would be flooded with light if the leylandii trees belonging to this property weren`t in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a bright location with a southwest facing back garden and southerly oriented side garden, but thick leylandii trees along the boundary block out an enormous amount of light and take up immense space. The large block-built garden shed is very pretty, but it also takes up valuable space in the sunniest spot in the back garden. Removing these would transform this property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is in a highly convenient location. Just around the corner is a neighborhood shopping centre with a Tesco Express and a large car park. Within the estate is both a highly regarded creche/montessori school and a national school. Across the road is a pedestrian entrance to Cabinteely Park which covers 110 acres with a duck pond, playground, trendy cafe, arts hub and of course plenty of room to walk and relax. Cornelscourt Shopping Centre and the N11 QBC are both within five minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction - Double leaf walls with internal insulation. Floors and internal walls sound insulated with rock wool. Ring beam at attic level. 9" thick internal joists. It still earns a respectable D1 BER rating even though energy efficiency has been compromised by installing radiators in the shed and in the attic rooms, by fitting a perspex roof in the sunroom, and by an older boiler which is only rated 79% efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Park in Cabinteely is one of the best family friendly locations in Dublin. It offers a mix of 3 and 4 bedroom family homes with extensive green areas. Within the estate is a large park with a trendy cafe and a very popular children`s playground. It also boasts a unique facility in `The Grain Store`, (mart.ie) a popular arts hub catering for all ages, including teens. In addition this estate features the highly-regarded St. Brigid`s National School, the exclusive Park Academy Creche and Montessori School, and a handy neighbourhood shopping centre including a Tesco Express, medical centre, pharmacy, coffee shop, take-away and dry-cleaners. This property is just a five minute walk from Dunnes Stores in the Cornelscourt Shopping Centre. The new retail centres in Cherrywood and Carrickmines are also close by. There is easy access to the M50, the LUAS and the employment centres in Sandyford, Central Park and Cherrywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the N11 turn west at the junction with the Clonkeen Road (R827) beside Dunnes Stores, Cornelscourt. At the T-junction turn left onto the Old Bray Road, and then take an immediate right along Glen Drive leading into The Park. Bear left at the roundabout crossing a small bridge, and take the right immediately afterwards.  #1a Vale View Avenue is the detached house on the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; pill.baked.plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Oil Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Viewings start on 16th &amp; 17th July. All viewers should register in advance by email, so that we can arrange an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1a Vale View Avenue is a fine detached house on a corner site facing a large green. It is newer than most of the other houses in The Park and built to higher specifications. It has four large double bedrooms on the first floor and a 5th bedroom with ensuite on the ground floor, in a small self-contained unit. In addition there are three reception rooms (including a partitioned sunroom) and two handy attic storage rooms. There are bathrooms on all levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid oak flooring in the hall, sitting room and dining area creates a natural flow through the house. The spacious sitting room has a large bay-effect window looking out on the green in front of the house. It boasts an attractive white marble fireplace with contrasting black granite hearth. Glazed double doors lead from here to the open-plan kitchen/dining room which is at the heart of this home. The Rangemaster cooking range and the central black granite-topped work space with breakfast bar provide the focal points. To the rear is a spacious sunroom with pine flooring which has been partitioned into two to create an artists studio and a back lounge. This space would be flooded with light if the leylandii trees belonging to this property weren`t in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a bright location with a southwest facing back garden and southerly oriented side garden, but thick leylandii trees along the boundary block out an enormous amount of light and take up immense space. The large block-built garden shed is very pretty, but it also takes up valuable space in the sunniest spot in the back garden. Removing these would transform this property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is in a highly convenient location. Just around the corner is a neighborhood shopping centre with a Tesco Express and a large car park. Within the estate is both a highly regarded creche/montessori school and a national school. Across the road is a pedestrian entrance to Cabinteely Park which covers 110 acres with a duck pond, playground, trendy cafe, arts hub and of course plenty of room to walk and relax. Cornelscourt Shopping Centre and the N11 QBC are both within five minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction - Double leaf walls with internal insulation. Floors and internal walls sound insulated with rock wool. Ring beam at attic level. 9" thick internal joists. It still earns a respectable D1 BER rating even though energy efficiency has been compromised by installing radiators in the shed and in the attic rooms, by fitting a perspex roof in the sunroom, and by an older boiler which is only rated 79% efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Park in Cabinteely is one of the best family friendly locations in Dublin. It offers a mix of 3 and 4 bedroom family homes with extensive green areas. Within the estate is a large park with a trendy cafe and a very popular children`s playground. It also boasts a unique facility in `The Grain Store`, (mart.ie) a popular arts hub catering for all ages, including teens. In addition this estate features the highly-regarded St. Brigid`s National School, the exclusive Park Academy Creche and Montessori School, and a handy neighbourhood shopping centre including a Tesco Express, medical centre, pharmacy, coffee shop, take-away and dry-cleaners. This property is just a five minute walk from Dunnes Stores in the Cornelscourt Shopping Centre. The new retail centres in Cherrywood and Carrickmines are also close by. There is easy access to the M50, the LUAS and the employment centres in Sandyford, Central Park and Cherrywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><rooms>&lt;b&gt;GROUND FLOOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bright space with high quality solid oak flooring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entrance hall - 6.1m (20'0") x 2.1m (6'11")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrance porch with tiled floor and sliding glass door.

Four steps leading to upper-level lawn. A large shed on the northwest side of the upper level straddles the boundary between #1a and #1 occupying the sunniest spot in the garden.

time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming ground floor maisonette with back yard in a historic setting at the top of a cul-de-sac, just a short walk from the vibrant heart of Dublin.This property has been owner-occupied for the last 14 years, during which time it has been extensively upgraded and very well maintained. It is presented in excellent condition. All appliances are included in the sale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This well-designed home makes excellent use of the space, In the warm heart of this home is a cosy fireplace which heats up the whole house when lit. The wood mantlepiece compliments the flooring in the main living area. This is currently furnished with a large corner sofa giving space for friends or family to sleep over. Tucked away in an alcove to one side is a custom built study area with bookshelves and a broadband connection point. To the rear it opens to a kitchen area with a small breakfast bar, to which display shelves and saucepan hooks add plenty of personality. From here a small lobby leads to the fully tiled utility space and shower room. A glazed door to the small back yard brings in natural light. This yard features a natural stone wall with immense character. The bedroom has two windows one opening to the front and the other to the privacy of this back yard from which it catches the morning sun. It has a spacious wardrobe 2.4m long and also benefits from flooring matching that in the main living area, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an up and coming area which benefits from shopping at Lidl or Aldi, and more traditional shops on Church Road in the heart of the East Wall community.Within 15 minutes walk you have Dublin Port and the North Docklands, The Point LUAS stop, The Three Arena and Fairview with its extensive park, DART station, Westwood Gym and Castle Dracula. 30 minutes will bring you to the IFSC, Grand Canal Dock, The Aviva Stadium, Poolbeg Boat Club or Dublin City Centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merchant`s Road is lined with tidy yellow brick homes which were built in 1907 for workers in The Merchant`s Warehousing Company. When these workers were locked out in 1914 they were also evicted from their homes. A plaque on the wall commemorates the centenary of these events which helped establish workers rights in Ireland. Thankfully these days you can be the proud owner of this property and no longer have to worry about being evicted from your accommodation or having to rear a family in such a small space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these houses were originally designed as separate dwellings upstairs and downstairs, each with their own front door. Apart from a kitchen/bathroom extension number 111 is still the original layout. Thankfully times have changed and a property of this size is no longer considered a family home. It would however be ideal for someone looking for a home for him/herself, of great character, within easy walking distance of work, shops, recreation and entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.

June. All viewers should register in advance by email, so that we can arrange an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional, two up two down Edwardian yellow-brick terraced house with hewn granite lintels and sills. This property has been exceptionally well-maintained by the current owner-occupier. Updates include a new bathroom fitted 2020, double-glazed tilt and swing front windows with integrated blinds fitted 2020, and new combi-boiler fitted 2018. It was rewired in 2006.  It is conveniently located within easy walking distance of The Docklands and Dublin city centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property comes with a fully equipped kitchen including cooker with gas hob, washing machine (new in 2020) and fridge-freezer. Off the kitchen is a handy additional larder space under the stairs. A glazed back door opens to the small, bright, yard. The main living room has a natural gas stove on a white painted brick hearth complimenting the finished pine floorboards. Downstairs has a generous 2.5m ceiling height helping to give it the feel of a larger space. Upstairs are two double bedrooms and a tastefully finished modern bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This area has a great community spirit. It is located in a rapidly developing part of Dublin epitomised by the new EXO building, close to Dublin Port and the North Docklands. There is a choice of nearby shopping at Lidl or Aldi, as well as more traditional shops on Church Road in the heart of the East Wall community. Within 15 minutes walk you have the North Docklands, The Point LUAS stop, The Three Arena, The Convention Centre, Eastpoint Business Park and Fairview with its extensive park, DART station, Westwood Gym and Castle Dracula. 30 minutes walk will bring you to the IFSC, Grand Canal Dock, The Aviva Stadium, Poolbeg Boat Club or Dublin City Centre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merchant`s Road is lined with tidy yellow brick homes which were built in 1907 for blue-collar workers in The Merchant`s Warehousing Company. When these workers were locked out in 1914 they were also evicted from their homes, triggering an outpouring of community support and mass protests. A plaque on the wall commemorates the centenary of these events which helped establish workers rights in Ireland. Thankfully these days you can be the proud owner of this property and no longer have to worry about being evicted from your accommodation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The houses on Merchant`s Road have great character. They are located within easy walking distance of work, shops, recreation and entertainment. Viewing is highly recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; bunks.buzz.select&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: No&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Viewings commence Tuesday 29th June.

site.</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Delightful home in walk-in condition. Fully modernized and beautifully designed to an exceptionally high standard.  Set on a corner site extending to approx. 1/3 acre, with potential to extend to the front, back or side (S.P.P). Sunny SW facing back garden with large sun patio. Plenty of space for a granny flat if required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current owners have transformed this home, remodelling it in recent years from a dated 1960`s property to a deceptively modern family home with an impressive B1 energy rating. This is the highest rating achievable without the use of solar panels or renewables, reflecting the superb insulation and solar gain in this property. The remodelling was done under the direction of Keenan-Lynch Architects and the supervision of a structural engineer, both of whom have provided certification of the works done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon entering this property you will be impressed by the superb natural light filling both the atrium hallway and the enormous open-plan family room. This room was created by combining the three original rooms on the southwest side of the building. It has a folding glass wall opening directly to the back garden, protected from the sun by remote control retractable sunshade and window blinds. On one end of this room is a top of the range kitchen, and on the other a peaceful recessed window seat. On either side of the kitchen are sliding doors opening to the utility room and to a boot lobby with back door. To the front are three additional rooms all with French doors opening in the arches of the front portico. These include a large, warm and cosy, drawing room with wood-burning stove, an artist`s studio (formerly an ensuite bedroom) with lofted ceiling and dual aspect glazing, and a quiet study carefully designed to minimize screen glare. This of course has a top speed broadband connection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are three more exceptionally large bedrooms, a spacious study, and a family bathroom. The impressive master suite has a large walk-in-wardrobe, designed to keep the clothes out of the living space, and a luxury ensuite with large window, Jacuzzi bathtub and a high pressure, rain head shower.  The gable windows are fitted with white plantation wood shutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 35m long, southwest facing, back garden here is a truly delightful private space with extensive planting, a large white limestone patio and lots of sunshine. A remote control louvred pergola and a retractable sunshade make this space usable come rain or shine. The jungle gym and trampoline are available to purchase if desired. In addition there is a 15m x 20m front garden set in lawn, and a 15m x 8m side garden with a driveway and a secluded magnolia garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is situated at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, well out of earshot from any road noise. There is a walkway to the bus stop on the N11 Quick Bus Corridor(QBC) which provides a rapid connection to Stillorgan Village, UCD and Dublin City Centre (30 minutes), with busses running every 5-10 minutes. In the opposite direction these busses connect with the LUAS at Cherrywood. Alternatively, if you prefer the exercise, this is just 30 minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popular flagship Dunnes Stores shopping centre is just one mile from the property. A new shopping centre to rival Dundrum is currently under construction in Cherrywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kilbogget Park is straight across the road ensuring no development will destroy your privacy. There are pedestrian entrances within 100m in both directions. This park is home to Cabinteely FC, Seapoint Rugby Club, Foxrock/Cabinteely GAA Club and Cabinteely Athletic Club. As well as the sports fields there is a cycle track, palyground, walking route, duck ponds and wildlife area, dog park, tennis courts and a running track. Close by is also the extensive 96 acre Cabinteely Park with a popular coffee shop, playgound, duck pond and "The Grainstore" arts and media centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an abundance of highly regarded schools and creches in the area. Cabinteely Community School is at the entrance to Shrewsbury Lawn. St. Laurence`s College can also be accessed without crossing any roads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should take a close look at this gem!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewings are by appointment with selling agent, Phil Thompson of Casey Kennedy Estate Agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; gravel.clouds.slam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Delightful home in walk-in condition.

An architect designed extension constructed in 2000 added a wonderful family room with a lofted ceiling and a large apex window. In addition to sizeable gardens front and rear, there is a very private sun patio to the side of this property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally a 3 bed bungalow, planning permission was obtained to reconfigure it to a 4 bed property with two large ground floor bedrooms, two bedrooms in the attic space and a large family room extension. This work was done in 2000. While the property has sufficient overall height to comply with regulations, the dormer was not configured correctly and comes up slightly short. Thus, this property is being sold as a two bed bungalow with the bonus of two spacious and very useful dormer rooms, with bathrooms on both levels. It should be noted that the house next door, with an identical roof height, has been converted in full compliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation consists of a lovely bright entrance porch, leading to an entrance hall with under-stairs storage and a separate guest WC. To the right is a large bright living room with a wood burning stove. To the left is a double bedroom measuring 3.5m x 3.1m. To the rear of this is the spacious master bedroom with ensuite. The kitchen has been extended into a large family living/dining room with a lofted ceiling, into which skylights could easily be installed, creating a generous space for the whole family. From here French doors open to the sun patio and a large apex window to the back garden. A useful utility room is off the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are two large dormer rooms and a family bathroom. These are very useable spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating system here was upgraded in 2015 with gas fired central heating fitted with remote Climote zone control and TRV valves on all radiators. When combined with the double glazed windows and dry-lining insulation it earns this property a decent C3 BER rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lovely house is conveniently located a couple of minutes` walk from a wide variety of shops and restaurants. The flagship outlet for Dunnes Stores Cornelscourt is located just up the road, There is a wide choice of highly respected schools in the area, including St Bridget`s National School and Loreto Foxrock. Sporting facilities nearby include Foxrock Golf Club, Leopardstown Racecourse, Golf Centre and Westwood Tennis and Gym, Kilmacud Crokes GAA Club and Cabinteely F.C. Soccer Club. The 110 acre Park in Cabinteely is a popular location for walking or running. It has a superb children`s playground and a popular coffee shop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a superb bus service from here to UCD and City Centre along the N11 Quick Bus Corridor (QBC). The Carrickmines LUAS station is just at the top of Cornelscourt Hill. The M50 is easily accessible but well out of earshot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gardens here are peaceful and quiet, giving plenty of space to further extend the property if so wished. At the top of the driveway there is access to a small sliver of land belonging to the house next door, as noted on the site plan. The contract for sale will not include this section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Spacious dormer bungalow with two large downstairs bedrooms and two dormer rooms upstairs.

very large house or even two (s.p.p.)! Sunny southwest facing back garden.  Approx 30m of road frontage onto Merville Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bungalow has an entrance hall, living room, kitchen, bathroom and three bedrooms. There is a large attic with 3 x velux windows, but no stairs. Beside the kitchen there is a side garden, about 10m wide, with a shed and double gates to the front. On the other side there is a storage shed between the house and the boundary. There is a studio at the end of the garden, through a gap in the hedge.The house does not do justice to the site. This is a prime opportunity to build the house of your dreams, on a generous site in a fantastic location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb location in the highly desirable Merville area of Stillorgan. Stillorgan Village nearby is a hive of activity with a well established shopping centre, a new library and retail plaza under development, and one of the top GAA clubs in the country. For commuting there is rapid access to city centre either on the frequent bus service along the N11 QBC, or on the LUAS. There is an easy walk to the Sandyford LUAS station up Merville Avenue and through Clonmore Park. Clonmore Park has a lovely playground and plenty of space to walk a dog or kick a ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is shopping nearby in Stillorgan Village, Beacon South Quarter and Dundrum Shopping Centre. Superb range of highly regarded primary /secondary schools and colleges nearby including St. Brigids National School, which is just around the corner, St Raphaelas Secondary School, Mount Anville, St Benildus College, Alexandra College, Wesley College, St Killians Deutsche Schule, Sion Hill, The Smurfit Business School and UCD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has been extensive infill housing in the vicinity of this property, providing plenty of precedent for development on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; debit.glow.landed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Detached bungalow on 0.25 acre site with enormous potential for a very large house or even two (s.p.p.)!

Stillorgan Shopping Centre. Set on a small lay-by off the main road. 29 St. Laurence`s was solidly built in the 1950s. Originally a 3 bed semi, this property was extended and upgraded (with the required planning permission) by the current owners in 2006, for their sons attending college nearby in UCD. It is now a 5 bed home with three bathrooms. The original kitchen/dining room is currently used as a 6th bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email.

Seaview Park, Shankill</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>4 bed detached house</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Number 27 is a detached house with garage on a generous site facing a large green. It is quietly tucked away on a leafy cul-de-sac. As you can see from the floor plans and site plan, it has enormous potential. There is 4.5m between the front door and the boundary, giving plenty of space to extend or to add a granny flat. The southerly facing back garden is over 17m long and up to 15 m wide. In addition there is side access on the other side of the house measuring between 1.08m and 1.95m wide. The total floor area under the roof is 156.7 sq.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property was very solidly built circa 1978. It has been completely cleared, leaving the ideal blank canvas for a beautifully situated family home. The reception rooms have a lovely open layout with a very large window to the front. There are windows on all four sides, making this an exceptionally bright home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seaview Park is a quiet cul-de-sac with a large green play area and a convenient walkway to the Spar and 45a bus stop on Shanganagh Road. It is superbly located just a short stroll from the sea and from Shankill Village.  Shankill is a well established community with well respected schools and a wide range of sports and leisure options such as Shankill Tennis Club, Shankill GAA Club, Shankill FC, Shanganagh Park, Woodbrook Golf Club, and the pretty gardens at Corke Lodge. It has a lovely range of shops and restaurants including the popular Brady`s Pub with sports screens and food options. This marks the start of The Dublin Mountains Way leading via a lovely peaceful forest walk through the woods in Rathmichael to The Leadmines and beyond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than 20 minutes walk from the house, at the end of Corbawn Lane, is Shankill Beach, which is ideal for an invigorating swim, walking the dog, or just relaxing and enjoying the panoramic vista stretching from Dalkey Island to Bray Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commuters and shoppers will appreciate the convenience of this location. Shankill DART Station is an easy 11 minute walk. The bus stop at the entrance to Seaview Park on the Dublin Road services many routes, including the 145 directly to Dublin City Centre, the cross city route 155 and the 84 bus route to Cherrywood.  The 45a is a frequent service linking Bray and DunLaoghaire. Beside the Cherrywood LUAS stop and transport hub there is a brand new shopping centre, to rival Dundrum, currently under construction. Other shopping options include the large Dunnes Stores in Cornelscourt which is just 8 minutes drive away, and the new Lidl Shopping Centre and medical centre in Shankill at the top of Corbawn Lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the roundabout on the N11 beside St. Columcuille`s Hospital, just before it becomes the M11, take the R837 Dublin Road towards Shankill. Seaview Park is your second turn left. In Seaview Park turn right and right again around two sides of the green. #27 is on your left facing the green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; implored.kiosks.friendships&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: No&lt;br /&gt;Garage: Yes&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Number 27 is a detached house with garage on a generous site facing a large green.

Newtown Villas, Blackrock, A94 H0A4</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>3 Bed Bungalow</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Charming period cottage ideally located close to the sea, the DART, and all the amenities of Blackrock Village. Number 1 was built by the Dublin United Tramway Company in the early 1900s, for the tramway inspector, his wife and their ten children.  It has recently been renovated throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the rear it is fully decked and surrounded by feature period walls giving the perfect space for totally private al-fresco dining alongside pots of flowers, herbs or vegetables. A doorway gives access to a secure rear entrance. This property is not overlooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cottage is entered through a hallway lit by a large window, with an adjacent cloak room/storage area. In the heart of this home is a well presented living room with skylights, wood flooring and a modern electric fire. To the left are two bedrooms each with period cast iron corner fireplaces. To the rear is a bright Kitchen/Dining room flooded with natural light from glazed doors to the back patio. Beside this is the main bedroom which also has a window opening into this rear decking area. On the other side a lobby opens to the family bathroom.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is presented in walk-in condition. It has benefited from recent extensive dry-lining and insulation. The roof has recently been re-slated. It has gas fired central heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pretty cottage with immense character will suit someone trading down, a single, a couple, or a small family. It is located in a cul-de-sac of 20 period cottages. The popular swimming point at Seapoint beach is just 10 minutes walk away. Seapoint is the closest DART station, just 550 metres (6 minutes walk)  from the house. A pretty promenade along Idrone Terrace, with views over Dublin Bay, leads to Bath Place in the heart of Blackrock Village, which boasts a wide range of shops, restaurants, pubs,  two shopping centres, a renowned medical clinic and an extensive park. Nearby are many highly regarded schools including Blackrock College, Sion Hill, St Andrew`s College, Willow Park and Carysfort National School. UCD is nearby and The Smurfit Graduate Business School is just up the road, while Trinity College and Dublin City Centre are easily accessible on the DART.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing is highly recommended. Viewings are strictly by appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; shins.green.type&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: No&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Charming period cottage ideally located close to the sea, the DART, and all the amenities of Blackrock Village.

pretty dormer bungalow with a Dalkey stone facade. It was solidly built circa 1969, and has been very well maintained and upgraded since then. It is beautifully presented in walk-in condition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four upstairs bedrooms plus a downstairs bedroom - which could easily be combined with the back lounge and downstairs shower room to create a spacious granny flat - see indicative floorplan image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bright and spacious home is located in a highly desirable cul-de-sac close to Cabinteely Village. It has large gardens front and rear. In addition to the existing generous floor space, there is potential to add dormer extensions (with plenty of nearby precedent) and lots of space to extend to the rear if required S.P.P. It has a sunny SW facing back garden measuring 19m x 13.25m with a large granite sun patio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation consists of an exceptionally bright and spacious entrance hall opening through glazed double doors to a very large living/dining room with three large double-glazed windows. This room has high quality Krona walnut flooring and a lovely white limestone fireplace with contrasting black granite inset and hearth - fitted with a high efficiency multi-fuel stove. Through the dining area is a kitchen/breakfast room with a SMEG range and an American sized fridge-freezer both of which are included in the sale. Beside the kitchen is a combined utility room and downstairs shower room - which could easily be sub-divided into two rooms. Completing the downstairs accommodation are two more rooms  - a bedroom and a back lounge/TV room - both of which have glazed doors to the back garden - through which natural sunlight floods in throughout the afternoon.  Upstairs there is a spacious main bedroom with ensuite, three more double bedrooms and a family bathroom. Both the ensuite and the family bathroom have full-size bath tubs as well as separate shower cubicles. There are fitted wardrobes in all the bedrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunny back garden features a granite paved patio, a 15.4sq.m. steel shed/workshop with work-bench included, outside tap, outside power points and gated side access on both sides.It is surrounded by walls 2.5 to 3.0 metres high, providing great privacy and security. To the front there is off-street parking for 4-6 cars. The porch/car port by the front door is ideal for unloading the car boot without getting wet. There is an EV charging point discreetly tucked away in one of the side passages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is exceptionally well located close to a walkway to the bus stop on the N11 Quality Bus Corridor(QBC) which provides a rapid connection to Stillorgan Village, UCD and Dublin City Centre (30 minutes), with busses running every 5-10 minutes. In the opposite direction these busses connect with the LUAS at Cherrywood. Alternatively, if you prefer the exercise, this is just 30 minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popular flagship Dunnes Stores shopping centre in Cornelscourt  is just one mile from the property. A new shopping centre to rival Dundrum is currently under construction in Cherrywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pedestrian entrance to Kilbogget Park is straight across the road.This park is home to Cabinteely FC, Seapoint Rugby Club, Foxrock/Cabinteely GAA Club and Cabinteely Athletic Club. As well as the sports fields there is a cycle track, playground, walking route, duck ponds and wildlife area, dog park, tennis courts and a running track. Close by is also the extensive 96 acre Cabinteely Park with a popular coffee shop, playgound, duck pond and "The Grainstore" arts and media centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an abundance of highly regarded schools and creches in the area. Cabinteely Community School is just around the corner from Shrewsbury Lawn. St. Laurence`s College can also be accessed without crossing any roads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a delightfully spacious home not to be missed - Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; values.rare.oldest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>57 Shrewsbury Lawn is a pretty dormer bungalow with a Dalkey stone facade.

cul-de-sac setting. Boasting five bedrooms plus a spacious home office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This home office has independent external access from the back of the car port, making it ideal for a home based business, additional rent-a-room income, or semi-independent space for a multi-generational family member or an au-pair. In many similar properties the car port has been incorporated into the living space, giving the potential to make this into a much larger space. There is also the potential to convert the attic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front is a dual aspect main reception room with interconnecting doors to the open-plan kitchen/dining room. This has a large kitchen window and glazed back door opening to a sun patio in the back garden which catches the afternoon sunshine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the mornings the sun shines in over the house into the back section of the garden.The upper level of the back garden has been reseeded with new grass. The swing set frame and the garden shed are being left with the property. A mature beech hedge gives excellent privacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are five bedrooms, a master with ensuite, three additional double bedrooms, and a single box bedroom over the car port. Both upstairs bathrooms have been upgraded with modern white sanitaryware and attractive tiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The windows to the front are the original wood-frame single-glazing. To the rear these have been upgraded to more modern PVC double-glazed windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internally there is wood laminate flooring throughout with the exception of the carpeted stairs and landing. There are upgraded internal doors on the ground floor. &lt;br /&gt;The fuse box was upgraded when the EV charging point was installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property has efficient gas fired central heating with Climote controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; much.slower.lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Spacious family home in a highly desirable, quiet cul-de-sac setting.

large 1961 four-bedroom house with enormous potential to become a fantastic family home. Great-sized reception areas and a lovely back garden with a westerly orientation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>42 Ballygall Road East is a large four-bedroom house with enormous potential to become a fantastic family home. Interconnecting reception rooms flow through a rear sunroom and to the spacious, westerly facing, back garden 25m / 80ft long. This property was solidly built in 1961. It was extended to the rear in 1986, for which full planning permission was obtained. It is now vacant ready for a new owner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Casey Kennedy, to ensure proper spacing of viewings, we request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next door there is a protected structure at 54 Ballygall Road East. In 2014 planning permission was granted by Dublin City Council for a new boundary wall 2.8m high along the front of this property. At that time the current hoarding was constructed, but nothing further has happened since. There have been no other planning applications submitted for that property.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation in #42 consists of a bright entrance hall with parquet wood flooring. Off the hallway to the left are two interconnecting reception rooms leading to a lovely bright bar room/conservatory to the rear catching afternoon and evening sunshine. Beside this is an open-plan kitchen/dining area with great space and light. There is a handy utility room and a WC off the kitchen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front, a converted garage has been turned into a home office. Upstairs are four bedrooms, three good-sized doubles and a single. There is an ensuite off the master bedroom. A slice has been partitioned off one of the largest bedrooms to give independent access to the small attic room. Re-integrating this into the bedroom would make the attic room a bonus space for the occupant of this room. The main bathroom has recently been renovated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic house, with great potential. There is plenty of room to build to the back or over the original garage subject to planning permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drumcondra and Phibsborough villages are also close by, and Ballygall Road East is a leisurely stroll from each of them and the city centre. The location couldn`t be better; it`s close to the city centre and the many shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants that Drumcondra and Phibsborough Villages have to offer.

Interconnecting reception rooms flow through a rear sunroom and to the spacious, westerly facing, back garden 25m / 80ft long. This property was solidly built in 1961. It was extended to the rear in 1986, for which full planning permission was obtained. It is now vacant ready for a new owner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Casey Kennedy, to ensure proper spacing of viewings, we request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next door there is a protected structure at 54 Ballygall Road East. In 2014 planning permission was granted by Dublin City Council for a new boundary wall 2.8m high along the front of this property. At that time the current hoarding was constructed, but nothing further has happened since. There have been no other planning applications submitted for that property.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation in #42 consists of a bright entrance hall with parquet wood flooring. Off the hallway to the left are two interconnecting reception rooms leading to a lovely bright bar room/conservatory to the rear catching afternoon and evening sunshine. Beside this is an open-plan kitchen/dining area with great space and light. There is a handy utility room and a WC off the kitchen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front, a converted garage has been turned into a home office. Upstairs are four bedrooms, three good-sized doubles and a single. There is an ensuite off the master bedroom. A slice has been partitioned off one of the largest bedrooms to give independent access to the small attic room. Re-integrating this into the bedroom would make the attic room a bonus space for the occupant of this room. The main bathroom has recently been renovated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic house, with great potential. There is plenty of room to build to the back or over the original garage subject to planning permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drumcondra and Phibsborough villages are also close by, and Ballygall Road East is a leisurely stroll from each of them and the city centre. The location couldn`t be better; it`s close to the city centre and the many shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants that Drumcondra and Phibsborough Villages have to offer. Within walking distance are gorgeous open green spaces like Griffith Park and the Botanic Gardens. Easy walking distance from a number of excellent sports clubs, national, and secondary schools and Dublin City University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Four Courts, King`s Inns, Beaumont Hospital, and Mater Hospital can be reached by foot.

staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully maintained and upgraded dormer bungalow in turn-key condition, exuding quality throughout. Set on 1/8 acre of very private, well tended, low maintenance gardens bursting with colourful flowers. When combined with the downstairs bedroom and bathroom, the garage space could be converted to a wonderful granny flat (S.P.P).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internally, a spacious hallway leads to a lovely, bright, open-plan, L-shaped kitchen / dining / living room with three large windows and two skylights. The fully fitted kitchen comes with integrated appliances included. There are three large bedrooms, two upstairs and one downstairs. An extra upstairs room has been converted to a large walk-in wardrobe for the master bedroom. There are fully tiled bathrooms on both levels.  From the lounge/sun room to rear, French doors open to a very private back garden. This has a raised patio area ideal for outdoor seating and al-fresco dining. The garage to the side gives space to extend if so desired (S.P.P.). There is also precedence in the area for dormer style extensions to upstairs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is situated at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, on the Kilbogget Park side of the road, well away from the N11 road noise. There is a walkway to the bus stop on the N11 Quick Bus Corridor(QBC) which provides a rapid connection to Stillorgan Village, UCD and Dublin City Centre (30 minutes), with busses running every 5-10 minutes. In the opposite direction these busses connect with the LUAS at Cherrywood. Alternatively, if you prefer the exercise, this is just 30 minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popular flagship Dunnes Stores shopping centre in Cornelscourt is just one mile from the property. A new shopping centre to rival Dundrum is currently under construction in Cherrywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kilbogget Park is over the back wall, ensuring no development will destroy your privacy. There are pedestrian entrances within 100m in both directions. This park is home to Cabinteely FC, Seapoint Rugby Club, Foxrock/Cabinteely GAA Club and Cabinteely Athletic Club. As well as the sports fields there is a cycle track, palyground, walking route, duck ponds and wildlife area, dog park, tennis courts and a running track. Cabinteely Village with a range of pubs and restaurants is close by. Beside the village is the extensive 96 acre Cabinteely Park with a popular coffee shop, playgound, duck pond and "The Grainstore" arts and media centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an abundance of highly regarded schools and creches in the area. Cabinteely Community School is at the entrance to Shrewsbury Lawn. St. Laurence`s College can also be accessed without crossing any roads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should take a close look at this much loved and immaculately presented family home!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewings are by appointment with selling agent, Phil Thompson of Casey Kennedy Estate Agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freehold property.&lt;br /&gt;Fine mahogany staircase (with protective carpet). &lt;br /&gt;White painted, solid teak internal doors with glazed panels.&lt;br /&gt;Brushed aluminium switches and sockets.&lt;br /&gt;Painted walls - no wallpaper.&lt;br /&gt;Grey painted wood panelling on hall stairs and landing.&lt;br /&gt;High quality 20 year medium oak laminate flooring - you get the look of solid wood, with added durability and low maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Triple glazed windows.&lt;br /&gt;Toughened glass roofs on sun room and side passage.&lt;br /&gt;New front door and matching window.&lt;br /&gt;New kitchen appliances in 2022.&lt;br /&gt;Garage re-roofed in 2022.&lt;br /&gt;Well-insulated roof and floor.&lt;br /&gt;High efficiency gas fired central heating with condensing boiler.&lt;br /&gt;Top speed, fibre broadband connection.&lt;br /&gt;Curtains not included.&lt;br /&gt;Awning not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; lock.both.task&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: Yes&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>VIEWING STRICTLY BY APPOINTMENT due to increasing incidence of COVID - to help protect residents, viewers and staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully maintained and upgraded dormer bungalow in turn-key condition, exuding quality throughout.

STRICTLY BY APPOINTMENT due to increasing incidence of COVID - to help protect residents, viewers and staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;97 Mount Anville Wood is a double fronted 4 / 5 bedroom detached home sitting in prime location at the end of a secluded cul-de-sac on the southern slopes of Mount Merrion. It is on a larger site with a very private south facing back garden backing onto the grounds of Mount Anville Primary School, a spacious front garden, and a side garden containing a detached workshop.  The house has been extended to the rear creating a bright open-plan kitchen/dining/living space with a large roof light and a glazed wall opening to a private sun deck. Off the kitchen area is a handy utility room. Double doors open to a good sized living room to the front with a large window and cosy fireplace. Across the hallway is a further room suitable as a study or fifth bedroom. Beside this is a guest WC.  Upstairs are four more double bedrooms with a master ensuite and a family bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a superb and highly desirable location close to shops in Stillorgan or Dundrum, and in proximity to the sea in Dunlaoghaire or Blackrock. Surrounding areas offer a variety of amenities, including eateries, shops, business hubs and parks. These can be accessed easily by car, bus, bike, or within walking distance for the more agile. The park nearby in Deerpark has a well-equipped children`s playground, a tennis club, playing fields and beautiful walking paths. In the springtime it is bursting with pretty spring flowers. From here there are expansive views right across Dublin Bay to Howth Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a superb range of creches, primary and secondary schools nearby. UCD is within easy walking distance. There is easy access to the LUAS in Kilmacud (15 minutes walk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local Schools &lt;br /&gt;Creche / Montessori&lt;br /&gt;Star Tots, Stillorgan&lt;br /&gt;The Park Academy, Booterstown&lt;br /&gt;Glenalbyn Montessori, Stillorgan&lt;br /&gt;Mount Anville Montessori, Goatstown &lt;br /&gt;The Children`s Academy&lt;br /&gt;Busy Bees, Kilmacud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primary Schools&lt;br /&gt;Mount Anville Junior School&lt;br /&gt;Oatlands Junior School&lt;br /&gt;St. Theresa`s Primary School&lt;br /&gt;Goatstown Educate Together&lt;br /&gt;Lycée Francais d`Irlande&lt;br /&gt;St Kilian`s German School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondary Schools&lt;br /&gt;Oatlands Collage &lt;br /&gt;Mount Anville	&lt;br /&gt;St. Andrew`s Collage&lt;br /&gt;Loreto College Foxrock&lt;br /&gt;Blackrock College&lt;br /&gt;New Park Secondary School&lt;br /&gt;St Raphael`s Secondary &lt;br /&gt;St. Benildus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; tips.maker.edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>VIEWING STRICTLY BY APPOINTMENT due to increasing incidence of COVID - to help protect residents, viewers and staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;97 Mount Anville Wood is a double fronted 4 / 5 bedroom detached home sitting in prime location at the end of a secluded cul-de-sac on the southern slopes of Mount Merrion.

is a stunning apartment located in this esteemed development in Dublin 6. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attractive accommodations include a large entrance hall with solid wood floors. A large open-plan kitchen/living area with solid wood flooring is located off the entry hall. Aurum Limonta Italian Wall Courture feature throughout the apartment. There is a breakfast bar in this high-end kitchen that includes Miele appliances. The living area is flooded with natural light throughout the morning thanks to floor-to-ceiling glass with an easterly perspective. The beautiful fire and built-in tv are a real eye-catcher and this was custom-built by Lamartine. This apartment has underfloor heating throughout and an air filtration system. The balcony provides plenty of solitude compared to other apartments, it is a lovely place to enjoy a morning cup of coffee in the sun. On-site concierge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three double bedrooms, one of which has been converted into a dining room. If you choose, you could restore it to a bedroom or use it as is or as a home office. With carpet, Aurum Limonta Italian Wall Courture wallpaper and built-in wardrobes by Cawleys in all the bedrooms.

side of Mount Merrion. It was solidly built circa 1952. It has been very well maintained by the one family over the years and is in good habitable condition, but would benefit from some modernization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1962  the house was extended to the side and to the rear, and the garage was converted to an extra lounge. This lounge was subsequently repurposed to a 6th downstairs bedroom with ensuite when the elderly owner could no longer manage the stairs. The extension was architect designed and the build quality was good for its time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delightful and tidy, easterly facing, back garden measures approximately 28m/90ft x 10m/32ft. There is a side access passage. At this time of year it features a beautify pink flowering camelia. At the end of the garden is a sun patio and garden shed, backed by the historic granite wall which used to surround the Pembroke Estate. This garden is open to the south giving excellent natural sunshine throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front there is a second pretty pink camelia beside the well-tended lawn, adjacent to off-street parking for up to four cars accessed via a lovely wide gateway. This property is not overlooked to the front as it is facing the junction with Thornhill Road, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation comprises of an entrance hall with porch, large reception room extending from front to rear and a back reading nook, where the lady of the house kept a good eye on all comings and goings. In the downstairs extension there is a spacious kitchen. The original garage has been converted to a downstairs bedroom/playroom with ensuite. Upstairs there are three bedrooms and a bathroom with separate WC in the original house, plus two bedrooms and a shower room with separate WC in the extension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a probate sale.

Area is immensely popular with families, due to its excellent schools, shops and sporting facilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillside Park is a small cul-de-sac of family homes built, off Ballyroan Road, in the 1960s. Number 29 has an East-West orientation ensuring the dual-aspect main living room has all day sunlight, while all the other rooms get daylight for part of the day. It is the perfect blank canvas with enormous potential to extend to the side into/over the garage and/or to the rear (S.P.P.) This property has been vacant for some time and qualifies for the €50,000 vacant home grant (supporting paperwork can be provided). This should cover items such as rewiring, new windows, insulation and a new heating system, creating a lovely modern family home in a superb location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Hillside Park there are walkways to Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan Boys National School, Scoil Naomh Padraig and Kids Inc Creche and Montessori, Saplings Special School and Sancta Maria College. Other schools in the area include Loreto Beaufort and Rathfarnham Educate Together, There is a good range of local artisan shops just down the road beside the Ballyroan Library on Marion Road. At the bottom of that road is Rathfarnham Shopping Centre and a footbridge over the River Dodder to Bushy Park.  Local sports clubs include Ballyboden-St.Endas GAA Club and a superb range of Golf clubs including Castle Golf Club, The Grange, and Edmondstown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; space.lease.fingernails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: Yes&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>The Ballyroan Area is immensely popular with families, due to its excellent schools, shops and sporting facilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email.

property on a large corner site, of approximately 1/5 acre, exudes potential for an enormous extension, a second large detached house, or to use the existing extension as a granny flat in a multi-generational home (S.P.P). Many houses like this in the local area have been substantially extended to the side, rear and into a third habitable attic level. A detached house was built on a similar plot to the rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ballyroan area is immensely popular with families, due to its excellent schools, shops, parks and sporting facilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillside Park is a small cul-de-sac of family homes solidly built in the 1960s, off Ballyroan Road, From here there are walkways to Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan Boys National School, Scoil Naomh Padraig, Kids Inc Creche and Montessori, Saplings Special School and Sancta Maria College. Other schools in the area include Loreto Beaufort and Rathfarnham Educate Together, The local area is home to popular sports clubs like Ballyboden-St.Endas GAA Club and a superb range of Golf clubs including Castle Golf Club, The Grange, and Edmondstown. Just down Marian Road, beside the Ballyroan Library, there`s a local SuperValu and a good range of artisan shops. At the bottom of that road is Rathfarnham Shopping Centre and a footbridge over the River Dodder to Bushy Park. Marlay Park and St. Enda`s Park are also within easy walking distance. From Hillside Park there is a pedestrian short-cut to Bugler`s Ballyboden House, established in 1798, serving good food and drinks to many generations of local residents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Property has double-glazed windows and gas fired central heating with a high-efficiency condensing boiler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probate has been granted and a speedy sale is anticipated.

Parking front and rear for lots of cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;French doors opening from both main reception rooms to the gardens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a country bungalow which was totally transformed by the current owners in 1999 with an extensive remodelling and a large two story extension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downstairs the kitchen/dining room and adjacent living room are connected by double doors, making it very easy to combine these into a single open-plan space. A corridor leads from there to a row of four downstairs bedrooms, each with a window taking in the views. two share a jack and jill ensuite and there is a further family bathroom at the far end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the back of the entrance hall there is a door to a 5th downstairs bedroom. Another door opens to the interconnecting craft room and exercise room, from which a back door leads to the rear parking area. These could easily be linked with the utility room / kitchenette in the self contained unit making that into a spacious 2 bedroom unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs there are two enormous rooms. The main bedroom has an ensuite, two velux windows and a corner window with the best view in the house.  The other room was designed as a bright artists studio with an open fireplace, three windows, three further velux windows and exposed beams.

Its intended use was as a boarding house for the workers from Great Drogheda and Northern Railways building Connolly Station. The station took 14 years to build. In 1846, the building became a public house and it was first named `The Signal House`. While known under this name, The Signal House was mentioned in James Joyce`s `Ulysses`. The surrounding areas of Talbot Street and Amiens Street were known to be rough and used as a red-light district, which is clearly known in Ulysses as `Monto`.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was then leased to a merchant called Hennessy, but then went on to be leased to the Cleary family. The Cleary`s did not have to pay for electricity costs as the railway bridge that was built was blocking the natural sunlight. The Cleary family ran the business for more than 90 years. Jim Cleary the original owner, was great friends with Michael Collins and Harry Boland, leaders of the Easter Rising. Both Cleary and Boland played hurling for Faugh`s hurling team. Jim Cleary also represented Dublin and achieved two All-Ireland medals and 4 Leinster medals for hurling. Collins was a frequent visitor to the pub along with Boland. This led to them holding numerous meetings there in relation to the 1916 Rising and the Irish War of Independence. They also received a lot of information from the rail and dock workers while drinking in the pub, about the comings and goings of British soldiers. The 1996 film `Michael Collins` starring Liam Neeson as Collins and many other well-known actors such as Alan Rickman, Julia Roberts, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea and Brendan Gleeson featured scenes which were filmed in Cleary`s. Another well-known Irish film `The Commitments` (1991), based on the book by Roddy Doyle, was filmed there also. The film `Term of Trial` starring Laurence Olivier was also shot in Cleary`s. The 2010 documentary `Ireland`s Greatest` narrated by Michael McDowell, was briefly filmed here in which the current owner and a local historian gave information on Collins and the pubs use over time. The bar has a preservation order befitting one of the Northsides oldest pubs and historical importance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details &amp; particulars contained within this brochure, are for guidance only and do not form part of any contract or intent to&lt;br /&gt;contract.

Michael Collins held meetings there during the 1918-21 War of Independence and frequently slept in one of the overhead apartments.Images of Michael Collins and other Irish heroes from the time still adorn the walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate Sizes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar - 102sqm. - 1,097sq.ft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lounge / Function Room - 179sqm. - 1,926sq.ft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History of J&amp; M Cleary`s Pub&lt;br /&gt;J &amp; M Cleary was built in the late 1800`s. Its intended use was as a boarding house for the workers from Great Drogheda and Northern Railways building Connolly Station. The station took 14 years to build. In 1846, the building became a public house and it was first named `The Signal House`. While known under this name, The Signal House was mentioned in James Joyce`s `Ulysses`. The surrounding areas of Talbot Street and Amiens Street were known to be rough and used as a red-light district, which is clearly known in Ulysses as `Monto`.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was then leased to a merchant called Hennessy, but then went on to be leased to the Cleary family. The Cleary`s did not have to pay for electricity costs as the railway bridge that was built was blocking the natural sunlight. The Cleary family ran the business for more than 90 years. Jim Cleary the original owner, was great friends with Michael Collins and Harry Boland, leaders of the Easter Rising. Both Cleary and Boland played hurling for Faugh`s hurling team. Jim Cleary also represented Dublin and achieved two All-Ireland medals and 4 Leinster medals for hurling. Collins was a frequent visitor to the pub along with Boland. This led to them holding numerous meetings there in relation to the 1916 Rising and the Irish War of Independence. They also received a lot of information from the rail and dock workers while drinking in the pub, about the comings and goings of British soldiers. The 1996 film `Michael Collins` starring Liam Neeson as Collins and many other well-known actors such as Alan Rickman, Julia Roberts, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea and Brendan Gleeson featured scenes which were filmed in Cleary`s. Another well-known Irish film `The Commitments` (1991), based on the book by Roddy Doyle, was filmed there also. The film `Term of Trial` starring Laurence Olivier was also shot in Cleary`s. The 2010 documentary `Ireland`s Greatest` narrated by Michael McDowell, was briefly filmed here in which the current owner and a local historian gave information on Collins and the pubs use over time. The bar has a preservation order befitting one of the Northsides oldest pubs and historical importance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details &amp; particulars contained within this brochure, are for guidance only and do not form part of any contract or intent to&lt;br /&gt;contract.

spacious, 1950`s detached home is desirably situated on the southern slopes of Mount Merrion hill. It is just a short walk from the children`s playground and local shops in Deerpark. It has a sunny westerly facing back garden 82ft/25m long and 12m wide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floor area of the original house was 126.5sq.m, with the extension to the rear and the two storey extension behind the garage this brings it to 183sq.m. If you add the garage, boiler house and adjacent passage to the back garden it brings the total floor area to 200.5sq.m. (2045sq.ft).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well located located close to a host of amenities including Stillorgan Shopping Centre, Schools (including Mount Anville and Oatlands College), Colleges, UCD and bus routes to Dublin City Centre along the N11 QBC. There is an excellent selection of sports clubs within easy walking distance including Deerpark Tennis Club and Kilmacud Crokes GAA Club, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner moved out of Dublin in the 1980s but kept this property on as a well-maintained rental. This is NOT a probate sale. It is now in need of modernization and adoption as  a much loved family home. It is vacant and ready for a new owner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is enormous potential to remodel this property and further expand it over the garage or into the back garden as desired. The existing rear extension was re-roofed recently with a pitched roof. skylights or a roof-light could be added into this space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Casey Kennedy, to ensure proper spacing of viewings, we request that viewers register in advance by email.

extended 1990`s home on a lovely quiet cul-de-sac close to the LUAS. Wood flooring throughout the ground floor makes this property feel bright and spacious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Casey Kennedy, to ensure proper spacing of viewings, we request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. Alternatively we are happy to arrange private viewings by appointment at this property. Please email or call the agent to schedule a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front is a well presented sitting room with a fireplace and a bay window. To the rear there is a large open-plan kitchen/dining room filled with light from two skylights and patio doors to the westerly facing back garden. The kitchen comes fully equipped with an island for extra storage. Separate utility room with washing machine included. The master bedroom with two windows, fitted wardrobes and an ensuite extends the full width of this lovely home.  To the rear are two more bedrooms, both with fitted wardrobes. The well appointed bathroom comes with a Jacuzzi bathtub. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full width extension built in 2005 provides a great living space in the heart of this home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It boasts a C1 BER rating which could easily be upgraded to a B3 simply by adding zoned heating controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front there is off-street parking for two cars. At the top of the cul-de-sac is a large green stretching all the way to the front of the estate which is approached through a pillared entrance with pedestrian gates either side. The granite name stone and attractive planting at the entrance show that this is a much loved and very settled family area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A walkway through to Sandyford Hall leads to the LUAS stop in Glencairn (10 minutes walk). On the way you pass the local shops in Sandyford Hall (5 minutes). For the weekly shop Dunnes Stores in Leopardstown Valley, Beacon South Quarter or Cornelscourt are all easily accessible, as is Dundrum Town Centre and Stillorgan Shopping Centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the front of this property there are lovely views of the Dublin Mountains, which are a great amenity for walking, running, horseriding or mountain biking. The delightful Fernhill Park and Gardens are just 15 minutes walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is vacant and ready for a new owner. There is no chain. Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; laws.light.tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Well-presented, extended 1990`s home on a lovely quiet cul-de-sac close to the LUAS.

bed / two bath apartment with balcony looking out past a peaceful courtyard fountain to the period Bushy Park manor house built circa 1700. This balcony get the evening sun from 5pm onwards. This development was very well built to exceptionally high standards in 2003. It is in a tranquil setting lined on two sides by the verdant open spaces in Bushy Park. It is located across the road from Terenure College, and just a short walk from the boutique shops, supermarkets, restaurants and pubs in Terenure Village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number 185 has a spacious open-plan living/dining room with glazed doors to the balcony and a real flame gas fire in the feature fireplace. Double frosted glass doors open to the kitchen which is equipped with an oven and hob, dishwasher, fridge-freezer and washing machine. A hallway leads to the two spacious bedrooms (master ensuite) and the family bathroom.  This property is freshly painted, vacant and ready for a new owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property comes with one allocated parking space in the secure underground car park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bushy Park House is a very well managed development on approx. 7 acres off a tree lined avenue surrounded by beautifully landscaped courtyards and gardens. Adding to the verdant open setting, the majority of parking is underground, with just visitor spaces above ground. It was designed by architects O`Mahony Pike to an extremely high specification, including central heating, a feature fireplace, traditional coving and full height glazing in the main living rooms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of an extensive open space network along the River Dodder, Bushy Park extends to 20.5 hectares (50.6) acres. The park originated in 1700 when Arthur Bushe of Dangan, Co Kilkenny, Secretary to the Revenue Commissioners, built the house known as `Bushes House` on a site of 4 hectares. A John Hobson became owner in 1772 and changed the name to Bushy Park, possibly after the park in London of that name. Purchased by Abraham Wilkinson in 1791 who added almost 40 hectares to the estate, he gave it as a dowry to his daughter Maria when she married Robert Shaw in 1796. George Bernard Shaw was a distant relative, his grandfather being nephew of Sir Robert Shaw (1st Bart). The Shaws were connected with Bushy Park for the next 155 years until 1951 when they sold the estate to Dublin Corporation. In 1953, the Corporation sold 8 hectares to the Sisters of Religious Christian Education (for Our Lady`s School) but later re-acquired 2 acres of woodland in 1993. The park is noted for its woodland walks, ornamental ponds, and beautiful Dodder Walk as well as catering for football, tennis, boules, a children`s playground, and an artisan market every Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service charge approx. €2847 p.a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the traffic lights at the junction of Templeogue Road and Fortfield Road turn onto the avenue leading to Bushy Park House (as shown in the second photo). If parking in a visitor parking space please be sure to register your car as directed on the signs. Apartment 185 is facing the fountain behind the original Manor House. Please ring apartment 185 from the front door intercom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; acute.pinch.avoid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Electric Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Casey Kennedy Estate Agents are proud to offer this 4th floor two double bed / two bath apartment with balcony looking out past a peaceful courtyard fountain to the period Bushy Park manor house built circa 1700.

Offaly E53 F992</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>Period House</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>This property is available to view by appointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coldwell Banker Global Luxury, assisted by Casey Kennedy Estate Agents, are delighted to bring Larch Vale House to market. This property has been impeccably updated to modern standards while retaining the original facade, the high ceilings and the beautifully proportioned rooms from the Georgian period. It is available for immediate purchase. After almost 20 years as their family home, the sellers now own another property, and there is no chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larch Vale House was originally built in the 1820s. It was the home of Rev. William Reynell Gresson the rector of the nearby Church at Borrisnafarney serving the Loughton House Estate, the town of Moneygall and the surrounding area.  It is perched on the side of Loyer Hill, with expansive views over the countryside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just 400 metres (1/4 mile)  from the village of Moneygall (the ancestral home of Barack Obama) along a wide road with a hard shoulder and a grass verge. In the village there is a highly regarded Primary School, a playground, GAA club, Football club, athletics club, basketball court, 5-a-side soccer pitch, gym, community-based cafe, Garda station, two pubs and a Catholic church. There is also a community garden marking the start point for a cycle route and a hill walking route.  On the opposite side of the village, the Barack Obama Plaza has a range of  food options, a convenience store, and meeting rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2004-2006 Larch Vale House was stripped back to the bare walls and fully renovated, including underpinning of all walls, new insulated floors, new wall insulation, new roofs, new staircase, new plumbing and new wiring. The current owners added the sunroom, two wood burning stoves, solar panels, and a new high efficiency condensing boiler, They also renovated and re-roofed  the outbuildings in the courtyard, underpinning the walls, and adding an electric car charger.  It now has a high C1 BER rating - which is impressive for a property of this age. It is not a protected structure, making internal adaptation of the house or converting the outbuildings for extra accommodation or business use, much more straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main house consists of formal sitting and dining rooms either side of a central entrance hall, with a home office / ground floor bedroom behind the staircase. It was extended to the rear in the early 1900`s with a spacious kitchen/breakfast room, large utility room/pantry, downstairs shower room/guest WC, and walk-in hot press. Off the kitchen there is a spacious sunroom built in 2010, with original stone walls along two sides and south and west facing Munster Joinery double glazing on the others. French doors from here open to the back garden / orchard area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original coach house has been converted into a delightful "long room" ideal for entertaining, with French doors fitted into the original arched carriage doorway, a lofted wood ceiling, and a high efficiency wood burning stove at one end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ground floor level has 9ft / 2.74m ceilings with coving and centre rose plasterwork, attractive chandelier light fittings, solid wood flooring and high skirting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs there are two very large ensuite bedrooms off the spacious first floor landing. On the second floor are two more very large bedrooms, a family bathroom and an eaves storage room / home office with two skylights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A list of contents is available upon request. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside, to the left of the carriage doors, through an opening in the corner of the courtyard, is a delightful secret garden catching the afternoon and evening sun - providing additional entertainment space in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is privately secluded at the end of a 300m  tree-lined driveway leading to an arched gateway which opens to a spacious courtyard and stable yard surrounded by an additional 307sq.m. of outbuildings- giving enormous extra space for various business uses and/or additional accommodation (S.P.P.). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property sits on 3.6 acres of land, including a 1/2 acre back lawn / orchard / kitchen garden - still with the original stone wall along the eastern side. Most of the rest of the land is in lawn and gardens to the front and side of the house, and either side of the driveway - giving plenty of space for play, entertainment and home-grown produce. This should be sufficient pasture for one or two horses if needed. More land should be available to rent or buy from neighbouring landowners if required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moneygall sits just off the M7 on the border between counties Tipperary and Offaly. The village, and specifically Ollie Hayes`s Bar, was made famous by the visit of Barack Obama in 2011.  It is less than an hour`s drive from Shannon Airport and 90 minutes from Dublin Airport. It is served by bus 854 which runs 3 times daily to the train station in Roscrea. Other local market towns include Nenagh, Birr famous for its Castle/Observatory, and Thurles with its GAA Museum. Limerick City is just a 40-minute drive. There are highly regarded secondary schools at Cistercian College Mount St. Joseph`s in Roscrea, Ursuline Secondary School in Thurles and St. Mary`s and CBS in Nenagh - all served by school buses from the village. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For outdoor pursuits there is a marked walking trail `The Loop of Loyer` on Loyer Hill and, for the more adventurous, there are extensive walks and cycle routes in the nearby Slieve Bloom Mountains. Equestrian facilities abound in this area, with a racecourse at Thurles and a local North Tipperary hunt. It is only a 30 minute drive to boating on Lough Derg and the River Shannon at Killaloe, Dromineer or Portumna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At just one mile from the much-frequented Barack Obama Plaza on the M7 arterial route from Dublin to Limerick, this location would be ideal for a family home or a destination venue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the M7 to exit 23, by the Barack Obama Plaza. Take the R445 through the village of Moneygall. The entrance to Larch Vale House is on your left 400 metres from the village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Oil Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>This property is available to view by appointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coldwell Banker Global Luxury, assisted by Casey Kennedy Estate Agents, are delighted to bring Larch Vale House to market.

Sitting on a plot of approximately 0.9 acre, the property offers significant scope for extension to the front, side, and rear, or even the potential to develop a separate dwelling  (S.P.P).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovingly cared for by the same owner for the past 60 years, the property has been enhanced over time, including a rear kitchen extension and a side extension incorporating a downstairs bathroom with walk-in shower, WC and wash hand basin, as well as a separate utility room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accommodation is well laid out. On entering, a welcoming hallway leads to a front dining room and a rear living room, which in turn connects to both the side extension and the kitchen extension. The kitchen enjoys views over the spacious rear garden and provides direct access to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs, there are three bedrooms: a large master double with fitted wardrobes, a second well-proportioned double also with fitted storage, and a third single bedroom, again with fitted wardrobes. A family bathroom completes the first floor accommodation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Externally, the property is further enhanced by a generous West facing rear garden, accessible via side and rear gates, offering excellent privacy and ample room for outdoor living. The corner position and size of the site make this property particularly attractive for those seeking a family home with space to grow or for buyers with an eye on future development potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;59 Whitebarn Road represents a rare opportunity to acquire a home with exceptional scope, in a highly sought-after residential location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Churchtown is a mature and highly sought-after residential suburb in Dublin 14, known for its tree-lined streets, established family homes, and excellent access to both the city centre and the Dublin Mountains. The area has long been popular with families thanks to its strong sense of community, convenient amenities, and excellent schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is ideally located at the junction of Whitebarn Road and Nugent Road, within walking distance of a wide variety of local shops, cafés, and services. Nearby Dundrum Town Centre offers an unrivalled choice of retail, dining, and leisure facilities, while the villages of Rathfarnham, Milltown, and Terenure are all close by, each with their own unique charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the proximity of Marlay Park and Bushy Park, both offering extensive green space, playgrounds, weekend markets, and scenic walking and cycling routes. The Dublin Mountains are also just a short drive away, providing easy access to hiking trails and outdoor pursuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connectivity is excellent, with regular Dublin Bus services and the LUAS Green Line at Dundrum and Windy Arbour providing swift access to the city centre and beyond. The M50 is easily reached, offering quick connections to the wider Dublin region and Dublin Airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area is well-served by a number of highly regarded primary and secondary schools, as well as sporting clubs, golf courses, and community facilities, making it a consistently popular choice for families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: No&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>59 Whitebarn Road is a substantial three-bedroom semi-detached home occupying a prominent corner site at the junction of Whitebarn Road and Nugent Road with rear access from a lane off of Nugent Road.

bungalow</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Dormer bungalow with a spacious and very sunny SW facing back garden. This property was build in 1958 and was occupied by the same family from new. The garage was converted and the sunroom and porch were added shortly after buying the property. It is the type of property which would make a delightful forever home. With a bit of TLC and modernization, it could well be a cherished home for the next owners for another 50+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downstairs accommodation consists of a front porch, front living room, dining room, rear lounge with a glazed door to the sunroom, downstairs double bedroom, downstairs shower room, kitchen with adjacent pantry, and a hall with under-stairs storage. Upstairs there are two bedrooms one double and one single. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A door from the landing leads to the rear attic space which has not been developed. All the neighbours in numbers 1,3,7,9 and 11 have added rear dormer windows and bedrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside there is a covered storage area behind the kitchen with a door to the back garden. To the front there is a lawn, flower bed and off-street parking for one car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area has an excellent range of amenities including a range of local schools such as  Riverview Educate Together National School, Templeogue College and St. MacDara`s Community College. Nearby sports clubs include St. Mary`s RFC, Templeogue United FC, Faughs GAA, St. Jude`s GAA, and Spawell Golf Academy. It is well served by busses 15A, 54A and 150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is vacant and waiting for a new owner. Probate was granted in November 2023. Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Dormer bungalow with a spacious and very sunny SW facing back garden.

This property was built in 1967 and owned by the same couple from new. It has been well maintained to a good standard and was regularly updated with improvements such as double glazed windows, extra insulation, new gas fired central heating and a new upstairs bathroom. It is presented as a blank canvas for you to apply your own decor. Probate has now been granted and the family are keen for it to become a happy home for a new owner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is well established potential to extend these houses to the rear and/or to add additional dormer rooms (S.P.P.), as has been done by multiple similar properties on the road. One of these houses has been extended to 277m2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favourite Room: We love the spacious living room with all it`s windows to the back garden and the granite fireplace matching the granite cladding on the front of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favourite Feature: Beside a spacious park with an enormous number of sports clubs and recreational facilities. A great place for children to play, make friends, and even walk through the park to local schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewings: To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property benefits from bedrooms and bathrooms on both levels. On the ground floor there is a bright and spacious entrance hall. Off this is a garage conversion room currently used as a study. To the rear are three rooms, the exceptionally large and bright living room, a kitchen and a dining room. To the front are two spacious double bedrooms. At the end of the hall is the downstairs family bathroom.  Upstairs there are two more very spacious double bedrooms and a modern shower room. There is also very generous eaves space for storage or conversion to additional dormer rooms (S.P.P.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shrewsbury Lawn is a cul-de-sac between the N11 and Kilbogget Park. Number 34 is situated on the Kilbogget Park side of the road, well away from the N11 road noise. There is a walkway to the bus stop on the N11 Quality Bus Corridor(QBC) which provides a rapid connection to Stillorgan Village, UCD and Dublin City Centre (30 minutes), with busses running every 5-10 minutes. In the opposite direction these busses connect with the LUAS at Cherrywood. Alternatively, if you prefer the exercise, this is just 30 minutes walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popular flagship Dunnes Stores shopping centre in Cornelscourt is just one mile from the property. A new shopping centre to rival Dundrum is currently planned for nearby Cherrywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kilbogget Park is over the back wall of this property, ensuring no development will destroy your privacy. There is a pedestrian entrance to the park just100m down the road. This park is home to Cabinteely FC, Seapoint Rugby Club, Foxrock/Cabinteely GAA Club and Cabinteely Athletic Club. As well as the sports fields there is a cycle track, palyground, walking route, duck ponds and wildlife area, dog park, tennis courts and a running track. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cabinteely Village with a range of pubs and restaurants is close by. Beside the village is the extensive 96 acre Cabinteely Park with a popular coffee shop, playgound, duck pond and "The Grainstore" arts and media centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an abundance of highly regarded schools and creches in the area. Cabinteely Community School is at the entrance to Shrewsbury Lawn. Johnstown Boys National School, Our Lady of Good Counsel Girls National School and St. Laurence`s College can be accessed by an easy walk through the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probate granted. Vacant (since 21st August 2022) and ready for a new owner. Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents are proud to present to the market this spacious detached dormer bungalow with large rooms and generous gardens on a highly desirable cul-de-sac, close to Cabinteely Village.

Expansive countryside views.</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Teach Thall is a secluded and completely private split-level bungalow backing onto natural deciduous woodlands. It rests on a south facing elevated platform with superb natural light and expansive views over the beautiful, unspoilt Avonmore valley below.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the 182sq.m. main house, there is a further 71sq.m. ancillary building, giving a total floor area of 252sq.m. for both combined. There is also full planning permission for an additional 192sq.m. house on the property (subject to local needs). The property sits on just under two acres of land. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIEWINGS: Please register in advance for viewings by email or by phone or text 087-2799131. Pre-registered viewers only please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This area has proven popular with creatives such as John Millington Synge, Seamus Heaney, John Boorman and other current celebrities who value living in the tranquility, seclusion and privacy of this locale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favourite Room: We love the front lounge with its lofted ceiling and dual aspect bay windows catching the natural sunlight and delightful views. In the evening the full-height feature chimney breast with wood burning stove creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favourite Feature:  Immensely private and peaceful setting surrounded by nature - with hardly a house in sight, but still within easy commuting distance of Dublin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teach Thall (The house over there) was built to a Finnish influenced architect design to blend in with its natural environment of outstanding beauty. It is a lovely bright property with windows on all four sides and five skylights. The southerly facing sunroom to the front is totally private, with stunning views. Bay windows in the lounge and dining room, and the gable window in the master bedroom, enjoy similar breathtaking views of the valley. The other windows all have various woodland aspects. The main house is split onto three levels - allowing you feel the mountainside inside this inspiring and unique habitat designed to spark both creativity and an appreciation of the natural environment into which it seamlessly fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation consists of a fully fitted kitchen with black granite counter tops and a Belling oven and hob. Beside this is a small utility space with outside door. Steps lead down to the dining room with wood flooring, bay window a welcoming red brick chimney breast with an elevated wood burning stove. From here steps lead down to the lower level lounge with bay windows, lofted ceiling with skylight and another matching hearth. French doors lead to a lovely bright sunroom which is glazed on three sides. A door leads off the lounge to another front room which offers many flexible options: a bedroom as used currently, a playroom or an additional living space. This was originally accessed via a door off the bedroom corridor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back up to the mid level, a door opens off the hall to a corridor leading to the bedroom area  - including a family bathroom, with a corner bathtub and a separate shower cubicle, plus two more bedrooms. Back up the hall you will discover a quiet reading nook with a peaceful view of the trees.  Passing this, there is a door to the guest WC on your right and access to the kitchen on your left. Upstairs is a spacious attic-wide master bedroom with ensuite. This has excellent natural light from a skylight and a large gable window beautifully framing the distant peaks either side of Glendalough, in the Wicklow National Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 metres from the back door of the main house, a second detached building boasts a fully equipped canteen with all- Bosch appliances - a den with a lofted ceiling and wood burning stove, echoing the Main House concept - plus a shower room, and two store rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, there is a large wood store and a spacious workshop to the rear of the main house - with a third useful shed tucked discretely under the front trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property has been in the same ownership from new. It has been well-maintained and regularly updated. Updates include rewiring, additional insulation, new  tilt and turn double-glazed windows, an added sunroom and internal remodelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally Teach Thall sat on just under 1 acre of land. In recent years the owners purchased a further acre of adjacent land containing a mature pine forest. They have recently obtained full planning permission for a further house on this land (subject to local needs). This approval is for a 192sq.m detached bungalow with three bedrooms and a study. It has been designed with extensive floor to ceiling glazing to maximise connectivity with its woodland setting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside, there used to be a front lawn on the platform in front of the house. This has now been gravelled to provide additional parking. Behind the house an outside staircase leads up to a crow`s nest entertaining area looking out over the house and the dramatic surrounding countryside. Steps from here lead directly into the mature oak woodlands to the rear, beyond the property boundary: This gives you access to glorious mountain and hill walking escapes where you and your best friend can go roaming for miles and miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nearby thriving towns of Roundwood and Ashford offer gourmet cafes, gastro pubs and destination restaurants like The Roundwood Inn, The Coach House, and Byrne &amp; Woods.

E9X2</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>Detached house on 1/3 acre</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Glenlucan Lodge is a recently constructed detached house. It is  in a very private location, discretely tucked away to the rear of Glenlucan House, behind electric gates on 1/3 acre of grounds - at the end of a cul-de-sac. There are gardens on all four sides. This property is not visible from the street. In front of the house is an ancient well, which was finished off in fairy tale style to create a most appealing garden feature.It boasts superb energy efficiency with an A2 BER rating and underfloor heating throughout both floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house has an attractive layout with spacious rooms and superb natural light The bathrooms, kitchen, porch, hall and landing are fully finished. The kitchen and utility room come equipped with top of the range SMEG appliances throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still needs personal touches such as soft furnishings including carpets/flooring and window coverings in the bedrooms and reception rooms. Fitting these is a simple job, which can be turned around very quickly if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation consists of a lofted porch leading to a spacious entrance hall with custom oak staircase. Under the stairs is a guest WC. To your left off the hall is a spacious self-contained room ideal as a living room, playroom or games room The rest of the reception rooms have a lovely open-plan flow from the main family room down split-level steps to the dining area and the fitted kitchen. From here French doors open to the back garden patio. Off the kitchen is a handy utility room with side door. Up the feature staircase there are four spacious double bedrooms each with their own ensuite bathroom. The two larger bedrooms also have walk-in wardrobes. In addition there is an extra room, suitable as a 5th bedroom, which is currently in use as a study. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenlucan Lodge was constructed in 2020. It is still as the builders handed it over, with a fully fitted kitchen and utility room, well-appointed bathrooms, floor tiling, recessed lighting, underfloor heating, oak doors, and a lovely oak staircase. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features include a fully fitted kitchen with a SMEG cooking range, solid beech wood counter tops and "Proboil" filtered hot water tap. a family room with "Jinto" gas stove and a sound system with fitted ACAI SW157 speakers,.four spacious double bedrooms with ensuites - including an ensuite bathroom with a Jacuzzi bathtub. There is parking for 6+ cars and an EV car charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to health and financial issues the owner never fitted it out with floor coverings in the bedrooms, living room or family room, or with curtains and other soft furnishings. This property is exceptionally well insulated and is close to passive house standards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gardens have been partially landscaped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the leaves are on the trees during the Spring/Summer this property feels very private and secluded. Rebuilding a fallen garden wall and planting extra evergreen screening would enhance privacy during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is serviced by mains water, waste water, electricity, gas and high speed broadband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Killarney Road in Bray turn into Glenlucan. In Glenlucan, turn left onto Glenlucan Court. At the end of this cul-de-sac go through the white gates and past Glenlucan House.

A large full height window opens from the main living area to the patio, creating a vibrant indoor/outdoor connection and flooding this space with abundant natural light. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ground floor apartment with NO STEPS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETS PERMITTED, as long as they do not cause a nuisance, or disturb the peace and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOW SERVICE CHARGE of just €1138 per annum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email.

A short hallway leads to the two double bedrooms each of which has a built in wardrobe and a connected well-appointed bathroom. This property has been owner-occupied for quite a few years. It is well maintained and presented in walk-in condition. The heating system has helped it obtain a B3 BER rating, which means this property should qualify for a lower rate "green" mortgage. It has high quality Rationel double-glazed windows.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property comes with one dedicated parking space in secure underground parking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levmoss Avenue is a mixture of own door apartments with duplexes over, separated by landscaped pedestrian walkways and cul-de-sacs. There is a high percentage of owner-occupiers. This helps create a really nice community atmosphere with neighbours sitting out on their patios on sunny days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in the same development as Levmoss Hall, Mimosa Hall and Weavers Hall.  #47 has one dedicated  parking space in a secure gated underground garage. There are visitor parking spaces on the access road at the top of the walkway, and also on each of the cul-de-sacs. It is a well maintained and attractively landscaped development. It is a quiet spot well away from any M50 road noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This apartment is ideally located in The Gallops, a highly desirable area close to Holy Trinity National School, Stepaside Educate Together Secondary School, Gaelscoil Shliabh Rua and Kilternan School of Music. A walkway leads directly from the entrance to Leopardstown Valley Dunnes Stores and LUAS Station. There is a basketball court, tennis courts and children`s playground in the large Glencairn green accessed from the corner of Levmoss Avenue. Molloys/The Gallops sports pub and bar/grill is a highly regarded local, ideal for a car free evening out. There is shopping nearby in the newly expanded Carrickmines Retail Park, Dunnes Stores Cornelscourt, the new shopping centre under construction in Cherrywood and the established centres of Stillorgan and Dundrum Town Centre. A footbridge over the M50 leads to Leopardstown Racecourse, Westwood Sports Club/Gym/Tennis/Swimming, Leopardstown Golf Centre, and Nord Anglia International School, as well as the employment hubs in South County Business Park, The nearby Samuel Beckett Civic Centre has an abundance of additional sports facilities including GAA, Soccer, gym, astro pitches, planned swimming pool as well as a library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>This property is owner-occupied.

R6K6</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>3 bed terraced</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>This gorgeous home was completely transformed in recent years, having been beautifully remodelled to an exceptionally high standard. It is presented in delightful turnkey condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely bright kitchen/dining room to the rear, interconnecting with the central lounge area. This whole space was originally one open-plan room. An extra height patio door to the back garden, and a large roof light fill this space with abundant natural light. Outside the tiled patio area is ideal for al-fresco dining. The fitted kitchen is attractively finished with white stone counter tops and breakfast bar enhancing the clean lines. A spacious utility room, guest WC and front sitting room complete the downstairs accommodation. The front sitting room could be converted to a 4th ensuitre bedroom if required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three existing bedrooms are exceptionally spacious king sized rooms with two windows each - enhancing the flow of natural light. Each bedroom also has it`s own bathroom. On the first floor the bedrooms have been remodelled to give two large ensuites and spacious full-length fitted wardrobes in both bedrooms. The bathroom and wardrobes in the bedroom on the second floor have also been upgraded.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bathrooms are all fitted with top quality NK Porcellanosa sanitaryware including wall mounted WCs with hidden cisterns, Wall hung wash hand basins with single lever mixer taps, fully tiled step-free wet rooms with high flow shower heads, heated towel rails and vanity shelves below three segmented mirrored medicine cabinets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Courtyard is a small development of just 10 spacious houses built in a walled courtyard at the top of Foxrock Park in 2003. The high wall blocks the road noise from the N11, making this a remarkably quiet and peaceful spot With just a single access point this is a secure and tranquil space with a great sense of community. The front garden area is beautifully landscaped and maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly desirable location, with a walkway from just outside the courtyard to Foxrock Church and to the transport links on the N11 QBC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High efficiency dual zone gas fired central heating, demand control ventilation, and added insulation contribute to achieving an excellent B2 BER rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internal fittings include high quality internal doors, brushed aluminium electrical fittings, and skirting board lighting in hall and stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside there are well tended and most attractively landscaped gardens, maintenance of which is included in the €1200 per annum service charge - along with bin collection. This property comes with two dedicated parking spaces. There is an EV connection point if required for each pair of spaces. On-street parking is available outside the entrance to The Courtyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautifully finished home in a superb location. It is ready for a new owner, and paperwork is all in order. Sellers have the flexibility to accommodate an expedited timeline if required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Courtyard is located at the top end of Foxrock Park. From the N11 turn onto Foxrock Avenue by Foxrock Church. Take the second turn left onto Foxrock Park, then take the 2nd left, up the hill. The Courtyard is on your right at the south end of this road.  If walking, there is footpath access from Foxrock Court, just behind Foxrock Church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Gas: None&lt;br /&gt;Water: Mains Supply&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: None&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: None&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>This gorgeous home was completely transformed in recent years, having been beautifully remodelled to an exceptionally high standard.

large bungalow sitting on 1/3 acre of secluded gardens. It is a unique property with immense charm secluded behind a cottage facade set well back from the road.  It was extended to the rear and to the side in 2006 to create an enviable family home. The high lofted ceilings with exposed wood beams, 11 skylights and wall-to-wall glazing, flood this house with superb natural light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is presented in excellent condition with solid wood flooring, a pretty robin egg blue fully equipped country kitchen (dating from 2006), attractive red brick features, and three chimneys.The main living room is a bright and expansive space with an apex window on one end, large windows along one side and a dramatic hearth featuring a solid fuel stove creating a warm focal point. This house incorporates a primary bedroom suite extending to over 70 square metres with a jacuzzi bathroom, walk-in wet room, dressing room and relaxing lounge area as well as the spacious king size bedroom with French doors leading to the back garden. In addition there is a second exceptionally large guest bedroom with ensuite, apex window, French doors and skylighs, and two more spacious double bedrooms with a family bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cedar Lodge is accessed through electric gates at the end of a short laneway off Sea Road. To the front is a gravelled parking area with space for four or more cars. Most of the land is to the rear where it is very private, surrounded by trees and shrubs. These gardens contain a large sun patio, a second paved play area, and an extensive lawn with a palm trees, rose garden and a play area with swing set, wendy house and a tree house slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cedar Lodge is situated on Sea Road which leads from the town of Kilcoole to the sea and the train station, This forms part of the popular Ballygannon walking loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kilcoole is the next stop on the southeast coastal train line past Greystones. It is a growing village community with a good range of shops (Tesco, Centra, boutique stores), primary and secondary schools and nearby sports clubs (GAA, soccer, athletics, rugby, golf, rowing, fishing, swimming, walking, sailing, tennis).

Kilcoole Rock is a rocky outcrop which was an easily defended site in ancient times. In the early Christan era monks from St. Comgall`s monastery in Bangor established a monastery here, giving the town it`s name. The remaining ruined church may date from the 12th century. In Victorian times it was known as a seaside health resort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is serviced by mains water, waste water, electricity,and high speed broadband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property has registered title which should greatly simplify the conveyancing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Main Street in Kilcoole Village take Sea Road east towards the sea.

Moving the attic access to the hall would restore this to a functional bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attic - 15.4m (50'6") x 40.8m (133'10")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enormous floored attic with an apex height of 3m and a gable window. This is living space in virtually every other bungalow of this type in Cherrygarth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Garage - 60m (196'10") x 2.42m (7'11")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjacent to the main house in the south side garden. Potential to covert to living space or replace with a modern extension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outbuildings - 3m (9'10") x 1.5m (4'11")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coal shed and outside loo. To the rear of the garage in the south side garden, outside the kitchen window&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back Garden - 9m (29'6") x 18m (59'1")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easterly facing back garden. Well tended gardens, designed to be low maintenance. It would be a fairly straightforward job  to remove the tiles and reinstate the back lawn. Approx 18m wide and up to 9m long. An old granite wall runs along part of the rear boundary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Side Garden (south side) - 16m (52'6") x 6m (19'8")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spacious south facing side garden getting lots of sun. 6m wide giving plenty of space to extend if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Side Garden (north side) - 15m (49'3") x 3.2m (10'6")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the front this leads to the porch and front door, giving excellent privacy. To the rear, behind the hedge, this forms part of the private back garden area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Front Garden - 18m (59'1") x 8m (26'3")&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off-street parking for up to 5 cars. Pathway to front door on north side of house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</rooms><directions>Going up Trees Road Lower from the N11 Stillorgan Dual Carriageway (immediately south of the Talbot Stillorgan

acres</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>The outstanding design and quality of this spacious and impeccable appointed bungalow shines through from the moment you step through the front door into the impressive entrance hall with it`s lofted ceiling, skylights, and chandeliers. Progressing through double oak doors into the main reception room which is equally impressive with its south facing wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling apex window, exposed beams and custom stone hearth. A matching hearth graces the large dining area which flows seamlessly into the spacious oak fitted kitchen with its marble flooring, polished stone counter tops, six ring gas range, American-style fridge-freezer and advanced water filtration system. An arched doorway leads to the enormous curved sunroom with windows facing South, East and West.  All the main rooms have French doors opening to the south facing sun patio - making this property ideal for large Summer parties and barbecues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing by appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin`s Rest is a large bungalow set on just over an acre of land within easy and safe walking distance of the pretty village of Avoca. It is a sun lovers paradise with a large south facing sun patio, an adjacent sun deck, a semi-circular sunroom and a dramatic south facing apex window to the main living area. It is ideal for entertaining with four sets of French doors leading from all the main living areas to the patio, creating a natural connectivity for lots of circulating guests. There is abundant parking for 20+ cars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you enter through the electric gates off a private road you are met by a covered portico leading to an impressive entrance hall soaring to a double height vaulted ceiling over 6m high.Through oak double doors is the main living room with the stunning apex window straight in front of you opening to expansive countryside views, a lofted ceiling with exposed beams overhead, solid oak flooring with underfloor heating underfoot, and a feature custom built sandstone hearth with solid fuel stove, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the right of the hearth a doorway opens to the large kitchen / dining room which is almost 12m long. This has a matching hearth, Italian travertine floor tiles (with underfloor heating) and triple aspect windows which include three kitchen windows and French doors opening from the dining area to the sun patio. The oak fitted kitchen - handmade by local craftsmen - has granite counter-tops, a 6 ring gas range, American style fridge-freezer and lots of storage space. The kitchen sink is located on a central island / breakfast bar making it a much more sociable space. Off the kitchen is the hot press with controls for both types of solar panels  (PV &amp; hot water). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through an arch to the left of the kitchen is a small boot lobby leading to an impressive semi-circular sunroom with a lofted ceiling, exposed beams, and windows on all sides (including more French doors to the sun patio). To the right of the kitchen is a good sized utility room with the central vacuuming system, laundry area with counter top and sink, and an outside door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A corridor runs 11m down the centre of the house forming a T with the entrance hall - on one end of which is a guest WC. Beside the entrance hall is another reception room accessed through double oak doors which was designed as a games room / playroom or formal dining room - but which is currently furnished as a 6th bedroom. A comms press contains controls for the sound system, high speed fibre broadband, internal cabling and the CCTV security system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leading off the corridor on the opposite side of the hall are the bedroom and bathroom spaces.  First up is bedroom 5 - a double bedroom with a window to the front. Next is the family bathroom which is exquisitely fitted with Italian fixtures and fittings including dark marble floor and wall tiling, fitted with a floating WC with hidden cistern, a floating WHB with vanity mirror, a free-standing floating bathtub with teak surround, and a corner shower. At the end of the corridor is an impressive and spacious master bedroom with oak flooring, a fully fitted oak walk-in-wardrobe, an ensuite with textured grey tiling, and French doors opening to a sun deck. Three more double bedrooms, including a second bedroom with ensuite, complete the internal accommodation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plans for converting the upstairs to more living space, but this has never been done as the current owners don`t need that much extra space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside there is a detached garage which is currently in use as a private gym, home office and shower room. There is also a separate wooden chalet which is used as a pilates studio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the property, to the west of the house - linked by a pedestrian gate - is a large walled and paved yard with wide double gates to the road, extending to 0.2 acres (140ft x 50ft) which currently is in use for overflow parking.

Immediately after The CornerShop turn left up a private road. Robin`s Rest is the first house on your left, 400m from the junction. The entrance gate is on a side road to your left. As well as parking through the main gates in front of the house there is space for many more cars in the 0.2 acre yard through the second gate on the side road just past the main gate. This yard is also part of the property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; split.sodium.shockingly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Water: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Under Floor Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: Yes&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>The outstanding design and quality of this spacious and impeccable appointed bungalow shines through from the moment you step through the front door into the impressive entrance hall with it`s lofted ceiling, skylights, and chandeliers. Progressing through double oak doors into the main reception room which is equally impressive with its south facing wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling apex window, exposed beams and custom stone hearth. A matching hearth graces the large dining area which flows seamlessly into the spacious oak fitted kitchen with its marble flooring, polished stone counter tops, six ring gas range, American-style fridge-freezer and advanced water filtration system. An arched doorway leads to the enormous curved sunroom with windows facing South, East and West.  All the main rooms have French doors opening to the south facing sun patio - making this property ideal for large Summer parties and barbecues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing by appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin`s Rest is a large bungalow set on just over an acre of land within easy and safe walking distance of the pretty village of Avoca. It is a sun lovers paradise with a large south facing sun patio, an adjacent sun deck, a semi-circular sunroom and a dramatic south facing apex window to the main living area. It is ideal for entertaining with four sets of French doors leading from all the main living areas to the patio, creating a natural connectivity for lots of circulating guests. There is abundant parking for 20+ cars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you enter through the electric gates off a private road you are met by a covered portico leading to an impressive entrance hall soaring to a double height vaulted ceiling over 6m high.Through oak double doors is the main living room with the stunning apex window straight in front of you opening to expansive countryside views, a lofted ceiling with exposed beams overhead, solid oak flooring with underfloor heating underfoot, and a feature custom built sandstone hearth with solid fuel stove, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the right of the hearth a doorway opens to the large kitchen / dining room which is almost 12m long. This has a matching hearth, Italian travertine floor tiles (with underfloor heating) and triple aspect windows which include three kitchen windows and French doors opening from the dining area to the sun patio. The oak fitted kitchen - handmade by local craftsmen - has granite counter-tops, a 6 ring gas range, American style fridge-freezer and lots of storage space. The kitchen sink is located on a central island / breakfast bar making it a much more sociable space. Off the kitchen is the hot press with controls for both types of solar panels  (PV &amp; hot water). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through an arch to the left of the kitchen is a small boot lobby leading to an impressive semi-circular sunroom with a lofted ceiling, exposed beams, and windows on all sides (including more French doors to the sun patio). To the right of the kitchen is a good sized utility room with the central vacuuming system, laundry area with counter top and sink, and an outside door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A corridor runs 11m down the centre of the house forming a T with the entrance hall - on one end of which is a guest WC. Beside the entrance hall is another reception room accessed through double oak doors which was designed as a games room / playroom or formal dining room - but which is currently furnished as a 6th bedroom. A comms press contains controls for the sound system, high speed fibre broadband, internal cabling and the CCTV security system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leading off the corridor on the opposite side of the hall are the bedroom and bathroom spaces.  First up is bedroom 5 - a double bedroom with a window to the front. Next is the family bathroom which is exquisitely fitted with Italian fixtures and fittings including dark marble floor and wall tiling, fitted with a floating WC with hidden cistern, a floating WHB with vanity mirror, a free-standing floating bathtub with teak surround, and a corner shower. At the end of the corridor is an impressive and spacious master bedroom with oak flooring, a fully fitted oak walk-in-wardrobe, an ensuite with textured grey tiling, and French doors opening to a sun deck. Three more double bedrooms, including a second bedroom with ensuite, complete the internal accommodation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plans for converting the upstairs to more living space, but this has never been done as the current owners don`t need that much extra space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside there is a detached garage which is currently in use as a private gym, home office and shower room. There is also a separate wooden chalet which is used as a pilates studio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the property, to the west of the house - linked by a pedestrian gate - is a large walled and paved yard with wide double gates to the road, extending to 0.2 acres (140ft x 50ft) which currently is in use for overflow parking. This provides plenty of space for a motor home, boat or other motor accessories. It could be used as a specialist play area or a work base or separate granny flat subject to planning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin`s Rest was very well built in 2006 to an exceptionally high standard with a top specification finish by a highly respected local builder.

Wicklow A67 FD27</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>Dormer bungalow</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>Delightfully situated in the pretty village of Glenealy - within easy commuting distance of Dublin by car or train - this dormer bungalow enjoys a secluded position, nestled in a small cul-de-sac with just 3 other homes near the heart of the village. It is deceptively spacious, with an internal footprint measuring 12m x 6.4m. Sitting on a generous 0.2 acre plot there is plenty of space to extend this property to the side or rear (S.P.P.). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is presented in superb condition, having been delightfully upgraded and very well maintained by the current owners.. It is very energy efficient with a B3 BER rating. It boasts underfloor heating throughout (no radiators), powered by gas mains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internally, a bright, spacious hallway opens into full length open plan living, with a bay window to the front, a side window, and French doors spilling out onto a large back garden (0.2 acres), including a 40m2 decking area which gets the sun until late in the evening. The wood-fired stove in the living area makes winter evenings particularly cosy. The structural support across the dining area has been cleverly disguised as a feature wood beam.  The Newcastle Design fitted kitchen features a 6 ring gas range, a Belfast sink and hand painted hardwood units with soft-close drawers. Above the fridge/freezer there is a wine rack- well out of reach of little hands. A matching fitted unit in the hall neatly provides space for coats and shoes, the trip-switch fuse box and the alarm panel. There is fitted storage under the stairs incorporating a useful utility space with fitted washing machine. Completing the downstairs accommodation is a bedroom and adjacent shower room - which could be ideal for someone with limited mobility, or as an extra lounge or work-from-home space. Upstairs are three more bedrooms, with master ensuite and a family bathroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a delightful home for lovers of the outdoors. With the best of village life and 5 minutes from the motorway network, Glenealy is a hidden gem in the garden of Ireland. It offers easy access to Deputy`s Pass nature reserve just across the road. Carrick Mountain is on the doorstep too for mountain biking, trail running and equestrian lovers alike. There is even a local rock climbing crag and any number of woodland walks. Nearby there is a highly respected Equestrian Centre and a Farm/Cookery School.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Joseph`s National School is just a short walk through the village. There are secondary schools nearby in Rathdrum and Wicklow Town. Glenealy village has two cafés, One located in Joly`s Garden Centre, a quirky spot serving woodfired pizza on Saturdays. The other, closer to home, also has an ice cream parlour and deli with brightly coloured private booths. The ubiquitous village store, aptly named "Nearby", sells a useful range of supplies, Hurlers pub has a great atmosphere. There are Catholic and Protestant churches with accompanying church halls providing spaces for various community groups to meet. For those of a GAA disposition - Glenealy has a strong history of hurling and camogie. The club is a focal point of the village and is very welcoming of new players.

There is an active Wicklow Sea Swimming Club which traces its history back to 1859.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For gardeners, Kilmacurragh Botanical Gardens and Mount Usher are both just a stone throw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also within easy reach are Avondale Forest Park with endless tracks, trails and of course the renowned treetop walk. The café overlooking the playground will make young parents happy.

It is deceptively spacious, with an internal footprint measuring 12m x 6.4m. Sitting on a generous 0.2 acre plot there is plenty of space to extend this property to the side or rear (S.P.P.). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is presented in superb condition, having been delightfully upgraded and very well maintained by the current owners.. It is very energy efficient with a B3 BER rating. It boasts underfloor heating throughout (no radiators), powered by gas mains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internally, a bright, spacious hallway opens into full length open plan living, with a bay window to the front, a side window, and French doors spilling out onto a large back garden (0.2 acres), including a 40m2 decking area which gets the sun until late in the evening. The wood-fired stove in the living area makes winter evenings particularly cosy. The structural support across the dining area has been cleverly disguised as a feature wood beam.  The Newcastle Design fitted kitchen features a 6 ring gas range, a Belfast sink and hand painted hardwood units with soft-close drawers. Above the fridge/freezer there is a wine rack- well out of reach of little hands. A matching fitted unit in the hall neatly provides space for coats and shoes, the trip-switch fuse box and the alarm panel. There is fitted storage under the stairs incorporating a useful utility space with fitted washing machine. Completing the downstairs accommodation is a bedroom and adjacent shower room - which could be ideal for someone with limited mobility, or as an extra lounge or work-from-home space. Upstairs are three more bedrooms, with master ensuite and a family bathroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a delightful home for lovers of the outdoors. With the best of village life and 5 minutes from the motorway network, Glenealy is a hidden gem in the garden of Ireland. It offers easy access to Deputy`s Pass nature reserve just across the road. Carrick Mountain is on the doorstep too for mountain biking, trail running and equestrian lovers alike. There is even a local rock climbing crag and any number of woodland walks. Nearby there is a highly respected Equestrian Centre and a Farm/Cookery School.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Joseph`s National School is just a short walk through the village. There are secondary schools nearby in Rathdrum and Wicklow Town. Glenealy village has two cafés, One located in Joly`s Garden Centre, a quirky spot serving woodfired pizza on Saturdays. The other, closer to home, also has an ice cream parlour and deli with brightly coloured private booths.

DA34</displayaddress><descriptionbrief>Ground floor apartment</descriptionbrief><descriptionfull>This bright and airy apartment boasts a nice open design with exceptionally large windows flooding it with natural light. The easterly facing windows look into the peaceful inner communal garden space. The westerly facing windows open to a quiet shrubbery area, the parking space for this apartment, and a high granite wall to the rear of Woodview Court. This is a well-settled community in a peaceful setting. It is less than 10 minutes walk from all the amenities in Stillorgan Village. Number 28 is a secure ground floor apartment with NO STEPS. It is tucked away in a secluded corner to the rear of the development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETS ARE PERMITTED in Woodview Court, as long as they do not cause a nuisance, or disturb the peace and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favourite Feature: Secure and peaceful location beside historic St. Brigid`s Church, with just a single access point through the ancient granite walls surrounding this development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewings: To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property was happily owner-occupied for many years. It was then occupied by one of her sons and has now passed on to her grandchildrern. Probate has been granted and a quick sale is anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon entering the apartment, you are greeted by a spacious and welcoming entrance hallway with two storage presses. Straight ahead of you is a door to the generous kitchen-dining room and to your left is a door to the main living space. These two rooms interconnect via double doors, giving a lovely open-plan feel - while still maintaining some distinction between the two rooms. Both these areas are flooded with natural light, thanks to the large windows that offer views of the communal gardens in the heart of this development. These spaces are perfect for entertaining, with ample room for a dining table and a comfortable seating area. The shrubs outside the windows currently provide a certain degree of privacy - but it may be possible to get these trimmed back upon request- and privacy provided by modern day-night zebra blinds instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kitchen is fully fitted with plenty of countertop space and the full range of appliances including a fridge-freezer, dishwasher and a washing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two bedrooms are both well-proportioned and feature spacious built-in wardrobes. The master bedroom opens to a partially enclosed patio/balcony area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bathroom has a WC, WHB and a Triton electric shower. It gets natural light and ventilation from the frosted glass window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This apartment benefits from ample storage space, with several closets and cupboards throughout the property. It has electric heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a designated parking space right beside the door. There are also additional visitor parking spaces and a bike shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woodview Court is a small mature development of just 33 apartments, most of which are owner-occupied. It is situated beside the historic St. Brigid`s Church which was likely founded from St. Brigid`s Monastery in Kildare in the 9th century. In 1781 a Rathdown slab with concentric circular markings, thought to be associated with Vikings who converted to Christianity in the local DunLaoghaire-Rathdown area, was found in the church grounds - confirming it`s Celtic Christian authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located in the sought-after area of Stillorgan, this apartment is within easy reach of a range of amenities, including shops, restaurants, pubs, and a selection of supermarkets. The new Stillorgan library is under construction. Stillorgan Shopping Centre, in the heart of Stillorgan Village, is less than 10 minutes walk from the apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rear entrance to Glenalbyn Sports Centre is literally just around the corner. This is home to Kilmacud Crokes GAA Club, Glenalbyn Tennis Club, Kilmacs Bar, a Gym, a Snooker Club,a Montessori School, summer multi-sports camps, the friendly Village Cafe, and a range of function and meeting rooms hosting among other things Yoga, Art and Dance classes, a Mans Shed, a Bridge Club and a Church. The Glenalbyn swimming pool was closed quite a few years ago. Plans for rebuilding it as a modern facility are at the preliminary design stage with DunLaoghaire-Rathdown county council. The recent success of Daniel Wiffen and Mona McSharry at the Olympics may help provide fresh impetus for this project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area is well-served by public transport, with frequent busses along the QBC providing quick and easy access to UCD and Dublin city centre. Pedestrian lights provide safe crossing from the outbound bus stop. There are also east-west busses from the village centre to DunLaoghaire, IADT and Tallaght&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this apartment offers a fantastic opportunity to own a lovely open home in a desirable location. It would make an ideal purchase for first-time buyers, people downsizing in the area, or those looking for a secure investment property in a quiet and convenient location for sons or daughters going to college nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation&lt;br /&gt;Entrance Hall - 3.29m (10`10") x 2m (6`7")&lt;br /&gt;Hardwood front door.

Côte d`Azur, the French riviera only 15 minutes` drive from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property consists of three period buildings which creates a rare development opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Certificat d`Urbanisme (administrative document which defines the constructability of the land) indicates these surfaces:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yellow Building Some 363 m2 (circa 3907 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;The White House Some 521 m2 (circa 5607 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;The Little House to the West Some 44 m2 (circa 474 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTAL Some 928 m2 (circa 9988 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE YELLOW HOUSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yellow House has accommodation on the ground, first and second floors.&lt;br /&gt;There is large substantial basement which could accommodate multiple cars and a possible&lt;br /&gt;wine cellar or storage.&lt;br /&gt;There is a large terrace overlooking the valley which possibly may be extended.&lt;br /&gt;The building has a traditional natural yellow colour on the facades, and Provencal tiles on the&lt;br /&gt;roof.&lt;br /&gt;The external walls of the building are stone and are representative of traditional of the Côte&lt;br /&gt;d`Azur exterior.&lt;br /&gt;The roof needs remediation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE WHITE HOUSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was previously an agricultural building with large areas volumes, many rooms.&lt;br /&gt;The external walls would appear to be of masonry; there is a cement render to the facades, flat&lt;br /&gt;tiles to the timber structure to the roof.&lt;br /&gt;Those floors which are visible have a structure of steel joists with masonry infills.&lt;br /&gt;The roof needs remediation.&lt;br /&gt;The inside, the structure, the walls, the stone have a lot of charm and character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE LITTLE HOUSE TO THE WEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Little House to the west of the White House is open on three sides. The structure is of brick columns. The roof is of flat tiles laid on a timber structure.&lt;br /&gt;Substantial works have been done to have electricity, water, telephone and optic fiber coming from the Route Nationale 7 along the track which leads to the buildings over some 300 meters.&lt;br /&gt;Solar power is an interesting as an off grid connection and stand-alone power source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a spring on the property and also two working wells on the site (one in the basement of the house and one behind the second larger building). These have historically provided the domain with the necessary required volume of water (house, swimming-pool, outbuildings and garden) even in drought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The land slopes from north to south down to a stream which would appear, according to the cadastral plan, to be adjacent to the property. With the exception of the land to the south of the buildings where there is some natural grass, the remainder of the land is covered with mimosa, as is all of the neighbouring land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The existing buildings (928 m2/ circa 9988 sq. ft) have been formally redrawn by a local architect with an objective to maximise the potential habitable as illustrated below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first detailed plan vastly increases the  habitable` area by linking the two main buildings with terraces, a swimming pool, Japanese garden and courtyards. This plan meets the basic family residential/holiday  clientele` requirements in the south of France for privacy and security overall with spacious and luxurious principal accommodation and separate accommodation and leisure areas for guests and other family members on holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other possible development alternatives are i) to convert the larger/higher building into a games/swimming pool/spa complex with accommodation or ii) to convert the larger/higher building into guest accommodation with stables alongside. There is a demand for stabling for horse people in this area and no residences with private stabling. The local livery facilities are full and this property is surrounded by thousands of hectares of protected forest for riding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the buildings are down a long exclusive driveway so there is no traffic noise. There are no other buildings in view even in the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NOF (National Office of Forest) has confirmed that a large swimming pool was historically on site in the meadow and the Company has the  right` to construct another substantial swimming pool. This would be important if the plot was divided and separate pools were required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is situated some 5 kilometres to the south-west of Mandelieu - La Napoule, below and to the south of the Route Nationale 7 or the road which leads&lt;br /&gt;through the stunning Esterel hills from Mandelieu to Frèjus. The property has its own exclusive entrance off the main road/Route National 7. The Route National 7 leads to Fréjus from Mandelieu, through the Esterel forest. The property is surrounded by a forest called Massif de l`Esterel, which is a protected area. Some very important properties are located in an area of 1 or 2 km.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is situated:&lt;br /&gt;- 23 kilometers from Fréjus&lt;br /&gt;- 13 kilometers from Cannes&lt;br /&gt;- 10 kilometers from Mandelieu-Cannes Airport (an exclusive airport for private aviation)&lt;br /&gt;- 35 kilometers from Nice airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two golf courses nearby (Golf Club de Cannes Mandelieu and Riviera Golf club), also the Marina, the beaches of La Napoule , Yatch Club and berthing area less than 10 minutes  drive. The property is situated in a spectacular setting of 10 hectares (25 acres) listed in the Cadastre of Town Hall as being Section CR, No 112 overlooking meadows and woodland. It is entirely surrounded by the  Forêt nationale` which is a protected area and nature reserve. The land slopes gently downwards from the principal house over a meadow to the river which forms the southern boundary. There is a natural lake to the south west of the house in the woods. The entire property faces south and is bathed in sunshine with spectacular views of the Esterel mountains. There is no similar property in the area so close to Cannes and the international airport. The location of the property is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is a wonder-world of adventure. There is a magnificent gorge, waterfalls, and tracks through the forest in all directions with a variety of wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indicative valuation of the property in its present state is Euros 4 million. Development of the  habitable` area at a high standard would cost approximately 3,000 euros per m2/ sq. There are no similar properties available in the area to use as a cost guide but after development the property value as a residence is estimated at upwards of Euros 12 million.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is significant upside value in this project. This property is in a very special location and the seller is only interested in a purchaser who wants to create an exceptional residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After development, the remaining free hectares would be considered as  exceptional site` classification and limited to  forêt domaniale`.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; operational.manicured.sabotaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Water: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: No&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>La Ferme de Saint Jean de Cannes   A rare opportunity to acquire an exclusive renovation project on a 10 Hectares (circa 25 Acres) of land plot on the Côte d`Azur, the French riviera only 15 minutes` drive from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property consists of three period buildings which creates a rare development opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Certificat d`Urbanisme (administrative document which defines the constructability of the land) indicates these surfaces:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yellow Building Some 363 m2 (circa 3907 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;The White House Some 521 m2 (circa 5607 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;The Little House to the West Some 44 m2 (circa 474 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTAL Some 928 m2 (circa 9988 sq. ft) of gross floor area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE YELLOW HOUSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yellow House has accommodation on the ground, first and second floors.&lt;br /&gt;There is large substantial basement which could accommodate multiple cars and a possible&lt;br /&gt;wine cellar or storage.&lt;br /&gt;There is a large terrace overlooking the valley which possibly may be extended.&lt;br /&gt;The building has a traditional natural yellow colour on the facades, and Provencal tiles on the&lt;br /&gt;roof.&lt;br /&gt;The external walls of the building are stone and are representative of traditional of the Côte&lt;br /&gt;d`Azur exterior.&lt;br /&gt;The roof needs remediation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE WHITE HOUSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was previously an agricultural building with large areas volumes, many rooms.&lt;br /&gt;The external walls would appear to be of masonry; there is a cement render to the facades, flat&lt;br /&gt;tiles to the timber structure to the roof.&lt;br /&gt;Those floors which are visible have a structure of steel joists with masonry infills.&lt;br /&gt;The roof needs remediation.&lt;br /&gt;The inside, the structure, the walls, the stone have a lot of charm and character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE LITTLE HOUSE TO THE WEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Little House to the west of the White House is open on three sides.

The entire property faces south and is bathed in sunshine with spectacular views of the Esterel mountains. There is no similar property in the area so close to Cannes and the international airport. The location of the property is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is a wonder-world of adventure. There is a magnificent gorge, waterfalls, and tracks through the forest in all directions with a variety of wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indicative valuation of the property in its present state is Euros 4 million. Development of the  habitable` area at a high standard would cost approximately 3,000 euros per m2/ sq. There are no similar properties available in the area to use as a cost guide but after development the property value as a residence is estimated at upwards of Euros 12 million.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is significant upside value in this project. This property is in a very special location and the seller is only interested in a purchaser who wants to create an exceptional residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After development, the remaining free hectares would be considered as  exceptional site` classification and limited to  forêt domaniale`.</description><rooms /><directions /><disclaimer /><landlordregistration

There is dual aspect glazing in all the main rooms. It is one of just two apartments in this development with a private balcony - and the only one with a sunny SE/SW aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This apartment has been owner-occupied from new and is beautifully presented. The walls are clean painted plasterwork, and the floors throughout are quality wood laminate. There is no carpet or wallpaper in the property. The updated ensuite bathroom is beautifully appointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As befits its period setting, the apartment has high ceilings with coving. High quality light fittings match the centre rose plasterwork. An attractive feature fireplace in the main living room is one example of appealing finishing touches throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a top floor apartment in its own wing, with no walls adjoining any other apartments, and just a pitched roof overhead. There is one apartment below. A dedicated outside door serves just these two apartments, with their own hallway and stairs. The entrance to this wing is situated to the right of the front steps to Marlfield House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside, Marlfield House is surrounded by well-tended lawned gardens, high laurel hedges and mature parkland. In the grounds there is secure bicycle parking and  a covered  bin house. The whole development is well maintained by a well-organized management company with a healthy sinking fund. With just 15 apartments, this low density development has an excellent sense of community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apartment comes with a dedicated parking space adjacent to the south entrance. Five visitor parking spaces are located to the north of the property. There is also plenty of on-street parking beside the green to the east of Marlfield House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of highly regarded schools nearby. Dunnes Stores in Cornelscourt is a popular destination for weekly shopping. Cherrywood provides an important work hub, transport hub, LUAS link and planned new shopping mall. Easy access to city centre via the N11 with its quality bus corridor. Well served by busses L26, L27 , E1 and E2. Cabinteely Village and the expansive Cabinteely Park with its popular walks, cafe and playground, are just a short walk from the property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing of this gorgeoius apartment is highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Johnstown Road turn into St. Gabriels.

Unique property with immense charm..Potential to extend and/or develop. Constructed circa 1994. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accommodation consists of an open-plan living/dining/kitchen downstairs with an attractive cut granite fireplace and French doors opening to the back garden. The shaker style maple kitchen with black granite counter tops, comes equipped with an integrated fridge/freezer, Belfast sink with brass mixer taps and en electric cooker with hood. The pine ceiling could easily be painted white if it is not to your taste. Upstairs are two bedrooms and a bathroom. Both bedrooms have dormer windows with views across Dublin Bay. The main bedroom is dual aspect with an additional gable window. There is also a gable window in the stairwell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is serviced by oil fired central heating, mains water, and a bio-cycle waste treatment unit. The block built utility shed contains both the boiler and the controls  for the bio-cycle unit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broadband speeds up to Gigabit 2000mbps are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is 30m road frontage with excellent screening. The wide gateway with granite walls and pillars provides plenty of space to pull off the main road while opening the gates,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is access from the property to Bride`s Glen Road via Rathmichael Lane, providing a handy shortcut to Cherrywood and the LUAS in Bride`s Glen (10 minutes walk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spacious gardens (approx 100m long and up to 30m wide) are mainly laid out in well-tended lawns with attractive "Narnia" stlye lamp posts. A utility cottage with old-style window, pitched roof, reclaimed hardwood door surrounded by sculpted plants provides an interesting focal point. By the south wall is a private corner surrounded by specimen maple trees and palms, where the owner likes to sit. A wooded area along Rathmichael Lane runs along the eastern boundary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laneway across the road leads to the Old Rathmichael Monastic Site which reputedly was established by St. Comgall in the 6th century. This contains the remains of the monastic enclosure, Viking/Christian burial slabs, a 10th century round tower, and the ruins of a church which may date to the early medieval period. From here a footpath over a stile leads to Rathmichael Woods, an ancient hill fort - near which is a well-known framed viewpoint of Dublin Bay - the Lead Mines chimney, and the Dublin Mountains Way, It`s about a 40 minute walk via this route to Brady`s pub in Shankill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A local area plan is crrently being developed for the Rathmichael area. This will substantially improve the local amenities. Rathmichael Road is one of the routes expected to be upgraded. As part of this development mains sewage and other modern infrastructure is likely to be installed..Overgrown Rathmichael Lane, adjacent to the property, is recognized as a green corridor which is likely to be retained as a walking/cycle path - providing significant screening from any new development.The field on the far side of Rathmichael Lane, is likely to be developed into housing and possibly a local area shopping, community and transport hub as outlined in the "10 minute community" development strategy.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DLR 10-minute community is a planning concept by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council promoting a sustainable neighbourhood model where residents can access essential services and amenities such as shops, schools, parks, and employment opportunities within a 10-minute walk or cycle from their homes, or by using high-quality public transport. This approach aims to create liveable, walkable, and inclusive communities that reduce car dependency, enhance the quality of life, foster a strong sense of community, and contribute to climate resilience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This delighful property is available for immediate purchase. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is currently parking for 4 cars within the gates. There is additional on-street parking on Rathmichael Hill (off Rathmichael Road, 100 metres to the west of the property).  Please honk your horn when coming in the gate so we can direct you to an appropriate parking space.  With 1/2 acre of gardens there is of course plenty of room for additional parking if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Water: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Oil Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Cute cut stone and red brick cottage on 1/2 acre of freehold land.

It is presented in turnkey condition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the four bedrooms there is a block built garden shed with a fibre broadband connection which would make an excellent work space - outside the main home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This home has a delightful open-plan kitchen/dining room with a new shaker style kitchen, handy larder, breakfast bar and bright food preparation area. The white marble counter -tops and splashback contrast beautifully with the kitchen cabinets. Throughout the ground floor there is high quality 30 year water resistant, wood laminate flooring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining the open-plan theme the door from the sitting room has been widened to create a larger opening connecting these two spaces. The original fireplace in the sitting room has been removed and instead there is an opening with a flue, prepared for a solid fuel stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a warm and energy efficient home with insulated walls and attic, new GFCH with combi boiler and Hive controls. It has been rewired and replumbed by the current owners, including new electrical sockets - some with USB charging ports. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are four bedrooms, with a lovely modern master ensuite. The hot press has been converted to a wardrobe for one of the bedrooms. The space over the stairs has been fitted out as a home office with fitted desk and shelving. If this is needed as a 4th bedroom, these could be removed to fit the head of a single bed. From the landing a retractable ladder leads to the spacious attic with an apex height over 6ft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside there is a paved front garden with off-street parking for two or three cars, and a pretty planted area with two palm trees. A covered side passage leads to the  back garden 75ft long, with a sunny patio area. This is open to the south and gets excellent sunlight. It is quite private and not overlooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom of the garden, the spacious block built shed, with pitched roof and window, has been fitted with electrical, plumbing, heating and broadband connections. It is currently in use as a home gym, but could make a very useful home office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a utility shed near the side passage which houses the boiler for the GFCH.

It is presented in turnkey condition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the four bedrooms there is a block built garden shed with a fibre broadband connection which would make an excellent work space - outside the main home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This home has a delightful open-plan kitchen/dining room with a new shaker style kitchen, handy larder, breakfast bar and bright food preparation area. The white marble counter -tops and splashback contrast beautifully with the kitchen cabinets. Throughout the ground floor there is high quality 30 year water resistant, wood laminate flooring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining the open-plan theme the door from the sitting room has been widened to create a larger opening connecting these two spaces. The original fireplace in the sitting room has been removed and instead there is an opening with a flue, prepared for a solid fuel stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a warm and energy efficient home with insulated walls and attic, new GFCH with combi boiler and Hive controls. It has been rewired and replumbed by the current owners, including new electrical sockets - some with USB charging ports. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are four bedrooms, with a lovely modern master ensuite. The hot press has been converted to a wardrobe for one of the bedrooms. The space over the stairs has been fitted out as a home office with fitted desk and shelving. If this is needed as a 4th bedroom, these could be removed to fit the head of a single bed. From the landing a retractable ladder leads to the spacious attic with an apex height over 6ft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside there is a paved front garden with off-street parking for two or three cars, and a pretty planted area with two palm trees. A covered side passage leads to the  back garden 75ft long, with a sunny patio area. This is open to the south and gets excellent sunlight. It is quite private and not overlooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom of the garden, the spacious block built shed, with pitched roof and window, has been fitted with electrical, plumbing, heating and broadband connections. It is currently in use as a home gym, but could make a very useful home office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a utility shed near the side passage which houses the boiler for the GFCH. This has electrical outlets and plumbing connections for a washing machine, dryer and upright freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This property is conveniently located close to Nutgrove Shopping Centre, Office Park and Retail Park - with an excellent range of shopping, eating and leisure options.

well-proportioned two bedroom apartment ideally located in the heart of Blackrock Village, one of South Dublin`s most desirable coastal neighbourhoods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set within a well maintained development on George`s Avenue, this stylish apartment offers a perfect blend of modern comfort and unbeatable convenience, just moments from the sea front, the DART, and a host of local amenities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apartment features an open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area, with large windows that allow natural light to flood the space, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The modern kitchen is fully equipped with an integrated oven, electric hob, dishwasher, washing machine, and a large fridge freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both bedrooms are generous double rooms, with the main bedroom offering direct access to a private balcony, perfect for enjoying a morning coffee or evening breeze. The second bedroom includes fitted wardrobes and a large window, offering excellent light and storage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fully tiled main bathroom is finished to high standard and includes a WC, wash hand basin, and a bathtub with an overhead shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location is truly second to none. The main entrance to Carraig Court is tucked beside the popular Hatch Coffee shop, facing the charming laneway of Bath Place, which leads directly to Blackrock Park, the DART station, and the sea front.&lt;br /&gt;Here, you can sit and take in the views over Dublin Bay, stroll along the coastline, or simply relax in the greenery of the park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackrock Village itself is known for its vibrant atmosphere and excellent local offerings, including a wide selection of cafés, restaurants, pubs, and boutique shops. The village also hosts a popular market and is served by two major shopping centres, The Frascati Centre and Blackrock Village Centre, both just a short walk away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commuting is effortless, with the DART providing swift access to the city centre, and a frequent Dublin Bus service running along nearby routes for those who prefer to stay above ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Water: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Not Specified&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: No&lt;br /&gt;Parking: No&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Apartment 15 Carraig Court is a bright and well-proportioned two bedroom apartment ideally located in the heart of Blackrock Village, one of South Dublin`s most desirable coastal neighbourhoods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set within a well maintained development on George`s Avenue, this stylish apartment offers a perfect blend of modern comfort and unbeatable convenience, just moments from the sea front, the DART, and a host of local amenities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apartment features an open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area, with large windows that allow natural light to flood the space, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.

/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delightful family home ideally located beside Phoenix Park - with one of the few remaining pedestrian turnstile gates directly across the road - giving plenty of space to roam, walk the dog, play, run or kick a ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a freehold property with no annual service charge. It is much newer than other properties in the area having been built in 1995 at the end of a terrace of three new houses, on the site of an earlier cottage. It was extended by the current owners in 2002. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been meticulously maintained as a family home and is presented in immaculate condition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure proper spacing of viewings, Casey-Kennedy Estate Agents request that viewers register in advance by email. We will contact you to schedule an exact viewing time within the advertised time range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the narrow facade this property is remarkably spacious. The entrance hallway stretches back 7.5m, with the beautifully proportioned sitting room opening to one side and a large kitchen-dining room privately secluded to the rear. The kitchen extension is a lovely bright space with a lofted ceiling, four skylights, patio doors and a large kitchen window looking out to the sun deck surrounded by flowers in the totally private back garden. The kitchen comes fully equipped with the full range of appliances, a breakfast bar and plenty of counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs are a family bathroom and three bedrooms - two doubles and a main bedroom stretching the full width of the house, with two windows and an ensuite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The property is equipped with gas fired central heating, triple-glazed windows and wood flooring in most rooms. This includes solid French Oak flooring in the hall and sitting room, with high quality laminate flooring in the dining areas and in both double bedrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a short walk from Cumiskey`s or The Hole in the Wall, and a short commute from Dublin City centre. Served by busses 37 and N2. Nearby shops include a bakery, coffee shop, post office, beauty salon and barbers - 5 minutes walk around the corner on Nephin Road.Other shops nearby, off the Navan Road, include the Maple Shopping Centre, Tesco`s and Lidl. It is a pleasant 30 minutes walk through Phoenix Park to the LUAS at Heuston Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preschool options include Blackhorse Childcare in Springfield - 1 minute walk, without having to cross any roads and Mother Hubbards beside the shops on Nephin Road. The area is served by St. Catherine`s Educate Together, St. John Bosco Junior and Senior Schools, and Stanhope Street primary schools and St. Dominic`s College,  St. Declan`s College, St. Paul`s CBS and Stanhope Street Secondary Schools. The TU Dublin campus in Granegorman is easily accessible.  There are also specialist schools for the deaf nearby at St. Mary`s and St. Joseph`s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ideal location for active people with polo, cricket, GAA and soccer clubs based in Phoenix Park, golf clubs nearby at Castleknock, Elm Green, Luttrellstown and Hermitage, a selection of local gyms, two swimming pools and all the wide open spaces and amenities in the Park, such as the zoo, Farmleigh, Furry Glen etc . You could even visit your neighbours in Aras an Uachtaran for a guided tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early viewing of this delightful home is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;what3words /// &lt;/b&gt; pose.tiny.admiral&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Utilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Gas: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Water: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Sewerage: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Broadband: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: Unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heating: Gas Central Heating&lt;br /&gt;Garden/Outside Space: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Parking: Yes&lt;br /&gt;Garage: No&lt;br /&gt;</descriptionfull><description>Last viewing Sat 23rd August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delightful family home ideally located beside Phoenix Park - with one of the few remaining pedestrian turnstile gates directly across the road - giving plenty of space to roam, walk the dog, play, run or kick a ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a freehold property with no annual service charge.

Kennedy Estate Agents are delighted to present this charming three-bedroom home, ideally situated in a quiet residential pocket of Harold`s Cross. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of busy roads, this property offers a peaceful setting while still being just a short stroll from all the conveniences and character that this vibrant neighbourhood has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly suited for first-time buyers, this home has been lovingly maintained and thoughtfully upgraded over the years.

Located in the heart of Stillorgan and offering a 140 ft long, south facing rear garden.  With double glazed windows throughout and off street parking for three cars to the front.

This house offers the potential to extend, subject to planning permission, while still retaining an extremely large sun filled rear garden.  The granny flat to the side could be incorporated into the property or used as an income.

The location is second to none with a range of both junior and senior schools all within walking distance.   UCD Belfield is close by.  The Stillorgan Shopping Centre is a short stroll away as is the Luas Stillorgan Stop.
